<h1 title="">BOY SCOUTS
<br />ON THE TRAIL</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">THE CAMP ON LONG POINT</span></h2>
<p>Stout Harry Ritter gave a sudden chortle of
glee and looked up from the copy of the
&ldquo;Long Point Snort&rdquo; he was languidly perusing
in the shade of some cedars behind Tent Four.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows, have you seen this stuff about
Bull Taggart?&rdquo; he demanded joyously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could we when you hog the paper the
minute it comes out?&rdquo; inquired Ted Hinckley
sarcastically. He had sent in a poem the day before
and for ten minutes or so had been waiting
with ill-concealed impatience to see whether it had
found favor with the editors. &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;
he went on impatiently. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get it
off your chest? What kind of bull has he been
throwing now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been chased by a shark,&rdquo; chuckled Ritter
fatly. &ldquo;Monster fifteen feet long pursued his
boat for over a mile out in the Sound. Tried to
upset him by bumping its nose against the keel.
This is rich! Four rows of teeth sharp as razors....
Gleaming white belly&mdash;stomach would have
been more refined, seems to me. Remember
Dolly Wade, who called &rsquo;em blue-<i>stomach</i> crabs.
Where was I? Um-um. Oh, yes. Monstrous
dorsal fin cutting the water like a knife. Gee-whiz!
Bull will kill me dead one of these days.
I s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;s training to be an author when he
grows up. You can have it, Ted; I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tossed the sheet lazily to Hinckley and
lounged indolently against the trunk of the cedar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he pretend he really saw it?&rdquo; asked
Steve Haddon, linking brown, muscular fingers
about an equally brown knee; &ldquo;or is it meant to
be just&mdash;er&mdash;fiction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he saw it, of course,&rdquo; said Ritter with a
giggle. &ldquo;No fiction about that. Recognized it
as a regular man-eater, too, by something or other
about its expression, didn&rsquo;t he, Ted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; Hinckley started guiltily and hurriedly
shifted his gloating eyes from the five-line
verse which, even in crude mimeograph, thrilled
him with the pride of authorship. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?
Oh! Why, sure! It&mdash;its teeth, it was.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Showed &rsquo;em in a glistening smile, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo;
chuckled Ritter. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think any self-respecting
shark would lick his chops over Bull
Taggart. Even served up on toast, he wouldn&rsquo;t
make a good, respectable bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a responsive chuckle from the half-dozen
fellows lounging in the shade; then Haddon
glanced questioningly at the tall, striking-looking
chap whose handsome head lay pillowed on Billy
McBride&rsquo;s knee, while his well-knit body stretched
out comfortably on the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any&mdash;man-eating sharks as far
north as this, are there, Cavvy?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I should think you&rsquo;d know better
than that.&rdquo; Jim Cavanaugh&rsquo;s tone was positive
and a little impatient. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re only found
in the south. The sharks around here are nothing
but big dogfish; I don&rsquo;t believe Bull even saw one
of those. He&rsquo;s the most unmitigated&mdash; Well,
Midget, what&rsquo;s your trouble? Don&rsquo;t you know
any better than to come in without knocking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An exceedingly small boy with snapping blue
eyes, a shock of sunburned hair and an amazing
self-possession of manner, darted around the tent
and paused in their midst, somewhat heated with
his haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; he repeated, scowling. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
plenty of trouble, let me tell you. What do you
know about their cutting us out of the Sound and
making us swim in the <i>kid&rsquo;s place</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&mdash;hat!&rdquo; came in an incredulous chorus;
and then: &ldquo;Cut out the fancy touches, Midge.
You&rsquo;ll be as bad as Bull Taggart if you&rsquo;re not
careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy touches!&rdquo; snorted the infant with cold
scorn. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you think, is it? Huh!
Well, it&rsquo;s up on the bulletin board in black and
white. &lsquo;Until further notice all swimming will
be restricted to the north side of the point,&rsquo; and
signed J. P. Wendell as big as life. That&rsquo;s the
kid&rsquo;s place, ain&rsquo;t it? And because why? It&rsquo;s
that nut Taggart shooting off a lot of bull about
seeing a shark in the sound. He&mdash;makes&mdash;me&mdash;sick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it was his purpose to stir up the group so
comfortably taking their ease in the heat of early
afternoon, Midge Willett was entirely successful.
With one accord six boys sat up abruptly, their
faces expressing varying degrees of surprise, incredulity
and indignation. And for a space the
air resounded with shrill question, heated comment
and fragments of argument which satisfied
even the small Willett&rsquo;s inordinate fondness
for attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, all right,&rdquo; he declared, spreading
his feet apart and rocking back and forth on his
heels. &ldquo;The stuff&rsquo;s all in the <i>Snort</i>; you must
have seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;So we have, Shrimp,&rdquo; admitted Cavanaugh.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve also seen yarns of his before. You don&rsquo;t
mean to tell us that Mr. Wendell takes any stock
in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Marshall says. He heard &rsquo;em
talking in Headquarters tent. Bull sticks to it
that it&rsquo;s true. He says he really saw a shark and
that it bumped into his boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if it did?&rdquo; demanded Cavanaugh, irritably;
&ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t believe it for a minute.
Why, the sharks up north here are as harmless as
kittens. They&rsquo;d no more tackle a man than&mdash;than
one of those stupid blow-fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the chief don&rsquo;t seem to think so. Bob
says he didn&rsquo;t know whether to believe Bull or not,
but he and Mr. Cartwright talked it over and decided
to cut out swimming in the Sound till they
find out something for sure. And then they stuck
up that notice, and now we&rsquo;ve got to go into that
rotten hole where you can&rsquo;t dive and it takes half
an hour to wade out to any decent depth. I&mdash;I&rsquo;d
rather stay ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A concerted groan went up in which stout Harry
Ritter joined heartily. Exertion of any sort was
distasteful to him, and it made little difference
whether he undertook his languid splashings in
the shallows, or in the wider, more varied waters
of the Sound. But he liked to criticize and seldom
lost an opportunity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>As for the others there was some excuse for
their annoyance. The scout camp was located at
the base of Long Point, which thrust its sandy
nose diagonally out into the Sound. Off the
southern side lay the open water, wide, deep, and
full of interest and variety. Here the older fellows
and proficient swimmers had always gone,
while the novices were limited to the wide, shallow
cove on the other side into which the tide had
swept such quantities of sand that for over a hundred
feet from shore it was not more than waist
deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midge is about right,&rdquo; sniffed Hinckley, as the
diminutive Willett departed to spread his news.
&ldquo;A lot of fun there&rsquo;ll be wallowing around over
there. Bull ought to have his head punched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big chump!&rdquo; exclaimed Cavanaugh bitterly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get his if I have anything to say
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up abruptly and shook off the sand.
The khaki shorts and sleeveless gym shirt he wore
showed off his fine figure and well-developed
muscles to uncommon advantage. Even the
scowl failed to detract noticeably from his good
looks, which were remarkable&mdash;the good looks of
clean-cut features, clear skin, glowing red under
the tan, blue eyes set wide apart, and wavy blond
hair.</p>
<p>Haddon watched him for a moment or two in
silence, his rough-hewn face oddly wistful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he&mdash;he might have thought it was
true,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly. &ldquo;Whatever he saw
he might have thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gee whiz, Steve!&rdquo; interrupted Cavanaugh
impatiently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to make excuses for the
nut. He just naturally can&rsquo;t tell the truth.
Who&rsquo;s coming for a walk? I&rsquo;m tired of sitting
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all arose briskly, even Ritter bestirring
himself. Walking was no particular pleasure to
him, but he rarely declined an invitation from
Jim Cavanaugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well stroll around by the bulletin
board and see if Midge got things straight,&rdquo; remarked
Hinckley as they moved away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to it!&rdquo; declared Cavanaugh decidedly.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen the beastly thing, and I&rsquo;m not
going to know anything about it till I have to.
At least we can get one more decent swim before
the lid&rsquo;s clamped on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;d go in anyhow?&rdquo; asked McBride
interestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? There hasn&rsquo;t been any official announcement.
Willett&rsquo;s no town crier that we
should take everything he says as gospel. If we
should happen to go over on the sound side at
three-thirty and went in there as usual, they
couldn&rsquo;t very well call us down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re supposed to undress in the tents and
wait for the whistle,&rdquo; remarked Champ Ferris
doubtfully. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s sort of funny
if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if you&rsquo;re looking for trouble you&rsquo;ll
find it,&rdquo; cut in Cavvy shortly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have
to come, you know. But if we hang around here
much longer some other busybody is sure to come
along and tell us about the notice. I&rsquo;m going to
start.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">FORBIDDEN FRUIT</span></h2>
<p>He led the way around the back of the
tent, which was the last one in the
row, and struck into a clump of cedars
bordering the clearing. The others followed
closely; Cavvy was somehow the sort others generally
did follow. Steve Haddon, bringing up
the rear, found himself thinking about this, and
for the first time in their brief acquaintance he
was a little troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he just doesn&rsquo;t look at it in that
way,&rdquo; the big chap said to himself as they came
out into the open and turned along the shore.
&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m too fussy. He&rsquo;s really a corking
fellow&mdash;corking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this fashion he tried to excuse the other and
dismiss the subject from his mind, but during the
stroll which followed he was conscious of a vague
discomfort that made him even more silent and
repressed than usual.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>From the first day at camp, little more than a
week ago, he had been attracted by the handsome,
accomplished fellow and in his shy, awkward
manner had even &ldquo;made up&rdquo; to him a little. To
his surprise Cavanaugh responded to a certain
extent, and the two became friends as well as tent-mates.
Steve could not understand what there
was about himself to interest a chap so brilliant
and so generally a favorite. It never occurred to
him that his own sturdy, steadfast strength might
have been the magnet which, consciously or unconsciously,
attracted Cavvy&rsquo;s more mercurial
personality. He would have laughed incredulously
had anyone suggested such a thing. As
it was he speedily gave up trying to make head
or tail of it and accepted gratefully the thing
which at first had seemed incredible. There was
always, to be sure, just the faintest touch of tolerance
in Cavanaugh&rsquo;s manner toward the big, black-browed,
quiet fellow whose admiration he could
not help but notice. It was the sort of attitude
which said, almost as plainly as words, &ldquo;Of
course, I know he&rsquo;s dull and heavy and not thrillingly
interesting, but he&rsquo;s a good hearted chap,
and I like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Steve noticed this he gave no sign. To him
Cavvy was a hero who could do no wrong. His
allegiance had never wavered until this moment;
and even now, troubled as he was and seeking excuses
and explanations for Cavanaugh&rsquo;s behavior,
he could not find that his liking had in
any way lessened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Following the shore line, with the wide, glinting
stretch of water spread out before them, the
talk of the boys almost inevitably turned on
sharks, and presently waxed so argumentative
that none of them seemed to notice Haddon&rsquo;s
silence. Nobody knew very much about the subject,
but that did not prevent them from taking
side and debating hotly. Hinckley and Champ
Ferris supported Cavanaugh&rsquo;s argument that the
species found in Northern waters was entirely
harmless, and probably there were none in the
neighborhood of the camp anyway. Taggart
had seen something else, or made up the whole
story, they declared. Ritter and McBride opposed
them as a matter of principle, and upheld
their side with such hair-raising anecdotes of
things they had heard and read that they actually
succeeded in scaring themselves, besides arousing
a certain amount of nervous apprehension in
the minds of the other two. Cavanaugh alone
laughed them to scorn. When they returned to
the forbidden bathing beach, which was hidden
from the camp by a thick screen of evergreens,
it was plain that he meant to carry out his purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we won&rsquo;t have time to go back to camp,&rdquo;
he remarked seriously, but with a twinkle in his
eyes, &ldquo;so we might as well peel right here.
Funny there&rsquo;s nobody else around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Hinckley chuckled and shrugged his shoulders.
Haddon felt a little sting go through him. Was
this the sort of thing Cavvy meant to get off
when they were discovered, as they surely must
be? He would rather have had his friend openly
break the camp rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;ve thought of the risk you&rsquo;re
taking,&rdquo; said Ritter, settling himself comfortably
on the sand. In spite of his airy tone there was
a touch of seriousness in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not going to join us?&rdquo; queried Cavanaugh,
kicking off one sneaker. &ldquo;You would make an
awful tasty morsel for a shark, that&rsquo;s a fact.
If you&rsquo;d only go in the rest of us would be quite
safe. What&rsquo;s the matter, Steve? You haven&rsquo;t
got cold feet, too, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;o; I just don&rsquo;t feel like it, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavvy paused, one stocking half off, and stared
intently at the boy&rsquo;s serious face. Suddenly his
color deepened and his lips curled a little at the
corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; And then he
laughed unpleasantly. &ldquo;I forgot we had with us
the only really perfect Scout in captivity. I&rsquo;m
surprised you could bring yourself to associate
with such a bunch of hardened sinners&mdash;or did
you hope by your virtuous example to win us
back to the straight and narrow path?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Steve shrank back as if he had been struck.
His face turned white and then a dull crimson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; sneered Cavanaugh. &ldquo;You
didn&rsquo;t have to say anything. You&rsquo;re so goody-goody
it sticks out all over you.&rdquo; He yanked
off his stockings petulantly and dropped the rest
of his clothes in a heap on the sand. &ldquo;Better
stick around awhile till you&rsquo;ve made sure we&rsquo;ve
broken the rules and then you can hustle back to
camp and report us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cavvy!&rdquo; cried Haddon sharply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no
right&mdash; You know I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off suddenly, biting his lip. Without
replying, Cavanaugh had turned his back and was
trotting out on the narrow spring board. For
a moment the shapely white body stood poised
against the deep blue sky. Then it flashed out
and downward, cleaving the water in a perfect
dive.</p>
<p>Steve watched him with blurred eyes and a dull
hurt in his heart. The onslaught had been so
brutal and so unexpected that it dazed him. He
did not realize that Cavanaugh&rsquo;s own mental discomfort
might have had much to do with the
flare-up. Conscious that he wasn&rsquo;t doing the
right thing, but too stubborn to draw back, it
was not unnatural to vent his irritation on the
fellow who seemed to be showing more strength
of character than himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Haddon did not think of this. In that moment
it seemed to him as if the friendship which had
meant so much to him had toppled into ruins like
a fallen house of cards. Rather, it had never
existed save in his own mind. If Cavvy really
cared for him, even in his careless, tolerant fashion,
he could never have deliberately hurt him
so without a shadow of reason or excuse. Surely
Steve had not shown himself the prig Cavanaugh
made out. He had not said a word against the
others going in. He had even been conscious of
an awkward sense of embarrassment at not joining
them himself.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of the turmoil of hurt and longing
and regret, came the desire to win back at
any cost what he had lost. If he went in with
the rest wouldn&rsquo;t Cavvy realize that he had been
too hasty, and perhaps make amends? It wasn&rsquo;t
too late. McBride and Hinckley, who had
stripped more leisurely, were even now moving
slowly toward the spring-board. If he hurried&mdash;</p>
<p>Instinctively the boy bent down and untied his
shoe laces with a jerk. Then he straightened
slowly, face flushed and jaw squaring. He
couldn&rsquo;t do it. Something within him made the
thing impossible&mdash;the action of a coward and a
weakling. What sort of a Scout would he be to
deliberately fling overboard his principles and
do a thing he felt to be wrong for the sake of winning
another&rsquo;s approval? And what was that
approval worth which could be won in such a
fashion?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Downcast, motionless, the boy stood fighting
out his brief mental battle. He was unaware of
the curious glances and low-voiced comment of
Ferris and Ritter, sitting together a little to one
side. For a space he did not even notice the three
fellows in the water save to be conscious of their
splashings and sputterings and occasional peals
of laughter&mdash;laughter which grated somehow,
and made him feel like one apart. Then Cavanaugh&rsquo;s
voice, still sharp and a little pettish,
brought his head up and his troubled gaze sought
out the fellow who had been his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of this fooling,&rdquo; he heard Cavvy say.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going for one last decent swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not go out too far,&rdquo; advised Hinckley
joshingly. &ldquo;Remember the shark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Cavanaugh disdained reply. Already he was
heading out from the shore, cleaving the water
with a swift, overhand stroke. Steve watched
him wistfully, and presently a faint touch of uneasiness
began to grip him. Spectacular as he
was at diving and other water &ldquo;stunts,&rdquo; Cavvy
had never showed up very well when it came to
long distances. He explained this once to Haddon
by saying that several times he had been attacked
by cramps and had learned to be careful.
Suppose a cramp should seize him now with
scarcely anyone around to help, thought Steve,
and instantly his uneasiness changed to acute
worry. In troubled silence he watched the fellow
draw further away from shore until at length
he could not restrain himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he turn back?&rdquo; he exclaimed
aloud. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s crazy to go out so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got more nerve than I&rsquo;d have,&rdquo; commented
Ritter. &ldquo;Suppose that shark should
show up now? Where would he be then, I&rsquo;d like
to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of that,&rdquo; returned Haddon,
who had been inclined to agree with Cavvy&rsquo;s side
of the shark argument. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s liable to
cramp, and if he should be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>He broke off with a sharp intake of his breath.
Out in the Sound Cavanaugh had turned suddenly
about and was making for shore with a wild
splashing haste which told instantly of something
wrong. For a second Steve stood rooted to the
spot. Then he ran toward the spring-board,
pulling off his shirt and jerking at the buckle of
his belt. As he paused a moment to kick off his
shoes and slide out of the scanty shorts, a shrill,
inarticulate cry of horror from Ritter urged him
on. It was the cramp, then, just as he had feared.
But Cavvy was still keeping up. He was even
making progress shoreward in spite of that
frantic splashing which wasted so much strength.
If he only kept his head&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The shark!</i>&rdquo; screamed Ferris suddenly behind
him. &ldquo;<i>The shark!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">THE SHARK</span></h2>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s feet were on the plank before the
meaning of the words stung into his consciousness.
As he ran, his startled gaze
swept over the glinting water and for an instant
his blood froze. Beyond the struggling Cavanaugh,
but much nearer to him than the latter was
to shore, something thrust up above the water&mdash;something
thin, triangular, erect, dull gray in
color, that cut through the little waves with swift,
smooth, gliding ease.</p>
<p>To Haddon it seemed as if the plank slid backward
under his feet. His dive was purely instinctive
but it was a fine one, wide and shallow,
that carried him well out. As he shot to the surface
he almost collided with Ted Hinckley, but
he was quite unconscious of the other&rsquo;s nearness.
Out of that numbed daze of horror and dismay
but one thought, one motive, rose to dominate
him. He must reach Cavanaugh before the shark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>What he could do then he did not know. But
as he tore through the water with that powerful
overhand stroke which had won him many a race,
his sturdy self-control began slowly to return.
Little by little scraps of things came back to him,
things he had read and heard, some of them part
of that very discussion on the beach so short a
time ago. Noise! That was the thing. Sharks
were afraid of noises. If he could only reach
Cavvy in time there might be a chance&mdash;</p>
<p>His hands struck the water with an even, rythmical
slap-slap. Though he had not slackened his
stroke, it seemed as if he were merely crawling.
The temptation to increase his speed was almost
irresistible, but he conquered it by deliberate
effort. Already he was breathing hard, and he
knew that unless he kept back some of his strength
he would be helpless at the crucial moment.</p>
<p>At almost every third stroke his dripping face
flashed up out of the water and his desperate gaze
searched the wide expanse for a sight of that ominous
fin. Twice he found it; once circling off
to the left of where Cavanaugh was swimming,
whereat he was thrilled with hope that the creature
had abandoned the pursuit. But the next
time it was cutting through the ripples straight
toward Cavvy, and the sight made Haddon throw
caution to the winds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>With every remaining ounce of strength he
lunged forward. His muscles ached, his lungs
were bursting. But still he managed to send his
weary body sizzling through the water at a racing
speed. Then Cavanaugh&rsquo;s face flashed up before
him, strained, white, panic-stricken, and he slowed
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on, old man,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Go straight
ahead. I&rsquo;ll stay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish. Already Cavvy had passed
him and was laboring shoreward. Steve gulped
in the precious air, took a few long strokes forward
and stopped with a sudden gasp. The fin
had disappeared!</p>
<p>The moments that followed were like nothing
that he had ever known. Cold horror gripped
him by the throat and choked him&mdash;that horror
of the unknown which is so potent and so paralyzing.
The shark had dived and was swimming
under water. At any moment he might feel&mdash;</p>
<p>For an instant he came close to screaming
wildly, to beating the water with that mad frenzy
which comes to drowning men. But just in time
his teeth dug cruelly into his under lip and he
jerked himself back into a semblance of sanity.
And then he began to shout and beat the water,
but with a set purpose. Noise was what the creature
dreaded. He could not hope to outswim the
monster, but in this fashion he might hold it off
till Cavanaugh was safe, and perhaps himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Ceasing his clamor he swam shoreward a dozen
strokes and then paused again to splash and shout.
Again and again he did this, and each time it was
harder to make that deliberate pause. He was
possessed by a panicky desire to speed ahead,
trusting to his swiftness. Once he did let himself
go and swam perhaps a score of strokes without
stopping. When he finally forced himself to halt
and glanced back over one shoulder, he seemed to
glimpse under the water not a dozen yards away,
a great gray-blue shape that struck terror to his
soul. He splashed frantically and shouted
hoarsely, and the thing slid away from his vision.
But he knew it was there, lurking, waiting for a
chance, and the remnants of his courage began to
drain. Six strokes was all he dared to take now,
and even those were halting and full of dread.</p>
<p>He had lost all track by this time of Cavvy; he
did not even know how near or far he was himself
from shore. Presently he saw the creature again,
nearer this time. As he strove to shout his voice
seemed a mere croak; there was scarcely strength
in his numbed arms to lash the water.... A
sudden splash near him brought a strangled sob
to his lips; the touch of something against his
body made him cringe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Steve,&rdquo; said a voice in his ear.
&ldquo;Just let yourself go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>With a long-drawn, sobbing sigh, the boy&rsquo;s
weary muscles relaxed and his eyes closed. He
was vaguely conscious of being propelled swiftly
through the water, of the clamor of shrill voices,
of a constant, irregular splashing all around him.
Presently his dragging feet touched bottom and he
made an instinctive effort to stand erect. But
now there was a muscular arm about him which
not only held him up but urged him forward.
Finally he felt himself lowered gently to the sand
and a moment later he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Stripped to the waist and dripping wet, Mr.
Wendell was bending over him. As he met
Steve&rsquo;s glance, his lips curved in a curious smile
that somehow thrilled the boy. There was pride
in it, tribute, appreciation, but when the man
spoke his voice was low and matter-of-fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better lie still for a minute or so,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re about all in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve nodded and his glance wandered over the
beach. It was thronged with boys, all talking excitedly
and many of them still hurling missiles at
the water. A sudden thought struck him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Cavvy&mdash;&rdquo; he began, raising his eyes.
And then he stopped.</p>
<p>The scoutmaster had moved aside; it was Cavanaugh
who stood beside him holding some garments
in his hands. His face was drawn and haggard,
and in his eyes was a look which neither
Haddon nor anyone else had ever seen there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Steve!&rdquo; he said at length, in a low, uneven
voice. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, his lips trembling.
Then his jaw squared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a beast, Steve, a
perfect beast!&rdquo; he went on rapidly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
a beast from&mdash;from the very first. You&rsquo;re&mdash; When
I think of what a chum you might have been,
and I was fool enough&mdash; You&rsquo;ll never want to&mdash;to
have anything to do with me again, but I had
to tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Haddon sat up abruptly. His physical
weariness had suddenly left him. All the regret
and longing and mental soreness of the afternoon
had vanished. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we&mdash;we just
forget all that and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused. A sudden flash like sunlight swept
into Cavvy&rsquo;s face, wiping away the haggard lines.
His eyes met Haddon&rsquo;s longingly, incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;d ever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve laughed happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Cavanaugh made no answer in words, but impulsively
his hand went out and caught Steve&rsquo;s.
To the onlooker it seemed as if he were merely
helping the other fellow to his feet, but Haddon
knew there was a good deal more than that in the
action. Cavvy&rsquo;s grip, and the look in his eyes
were both more eloquent than speech. Then Mr.
Wendell appeared beside them, his face puzzled
and a little stern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Feeling all right again?&rdquo; he asked Haddon.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. Well, I guess we&rsquo;d better get back
to camp; there seems to be nothing more doing
here.&rdquo; He turned abruptly to Cavanaugh.
&ldquo;Perhaps you can explain this business,&rdquo; he said
rather curtly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to make head or
tail out of what Hinckley and McBride have to
say. How did you come to go in over here when
there&rsquo;s a notice up forbidding it for the present?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE MAN IN THE DORY</span></h2>
<p>Cavvy hesitated for an instant, a slow
flush creeping up into his face. Then
his eyes met Haddon&rsquo;s and his lips tightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my fault, sir,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;The
other fellows aren&rsquo;t to blame; they&rsquo;d never have
gone in but for me. You see, I didn&rsquo;t believe
Bu&mdash;er&mdash;Taggart really saw a shark at all, and I
wanted to get one more decent swim before I saw
the notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scoutmaster&rsquo;s face cleared. &ldquo;Oh, then you
didn&rsquo;t see the notice,&rdquo; he said, turning toward the
camp. &ldquo;That makes a difference, though I still
don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t <i>see</i> it,&rdquo; interrupted Cavvy, &ldquo;but one
of the fellows told us about it. I hadn&rsquo;t any excuse
at all. I was just sore and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words died away as the two moved off together,
leaving Steve to hurry through his dressing
alone. He got into his clothes swiftly, a little
anxious to know what penalty was being meted
out to Cavvy, but in his heart there was nothing
but gladness at the realization that he hadn&rsquo;t been
mistaken in his friend after all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>He was given little time to think of this or to
speculate on the possibilities that Cavvy&rsquo;s changed
attitude opened up before him. He had not even
got his shoes on before he was surrounded by a
throng of boys, all jabbering excitedly and full of
eager inquiries as to how near the shark had come,
what it looked like, how he felt, and a thousand
other questions.</p>
<p>Haddon answered them all good naturedly, turning
aside with a shrug and a laugh the words of
praise and admiration which followed. As soon
as he was dressed he headed for the camp, to find
Cavanaugh standing in front of their tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he questioned eagerly as he came up.
&ldquo;How about it? What did he give you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavvy grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as much as I expected,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
was pretty decent, considering. I&rsquo;ve got to stick
around the camp limits for a week, that&rsquo;s all. He
didn&rsquo;t even cut out my swimming. Guess he
thought going into the cove wouldn&rsquo;t be any too
much of a treat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed; then his face grew suddenly serious.
&ldquo;I never even thanked you, old man,&rdquo; he
said in a low tone, &ldquo;or said a word about the
corking way you&mdash;you went in after me, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; interrupted Haddon, smiling a
little. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have done the same for me, and
more. Let&rsquo;s cross it off the books and not think
about it again. There&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;d like awfully
to know,&rdquo; he want on quickly. &ldquo;Was it really a
man-eater, or just a big dog fish? How close did
he get to you, anyhow? How much of him did
you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How close?&rdquo; repeated Cavvy slowly. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know exactly. It must have come within
twenty-five feet, though. It was a sort of blue-gray&mdash;different
from a dog fish. And big!
Man!&rdquo; His eyes widened and he shuddered a
little. &ldquo;Of course I was scared,&rdquo; he confessed,
&ldquo;and maybe the reflection on the water sort of
magnified it, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; put in Haddon as
he paused. &ldquo;It looked like a whale of a thing to
me. Say, Harry,&rdquo; he called, to Ritter who was
loitering nearby, &ldquo;how much did you and Champ
see of the brute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it appeared that they had only seen the fin,
and no one else had glimpsed of the creature.
Next morning, however, the matter was settled beyond
a doubt, and very satisfactorily. About an
hour after breakfast Shrimp Willett came tearing
into camp with the news that some fishermen
whose nets were out about a mile from shore were
having trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re having the dickens of a scrap with
something in the nets, fellows,&rdquo; he panted.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got three boats out there and the men
are stabbing and hitting with boat hooks and
things, and the water&rsquo;s shooting up all around in
regular geysers. I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s the shark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and rushed away again, and with a
chorus of excited yells every boy within earshot
streamed after him up the beach. The scoutmaster
was away in the motor boat for supplies,
but Bruce Cartwright, hearing the commotion,
snatched up a pair of field glasses and followed
the crowd.</p>
<p>The nets were set off shore about half a mile
above the scout camp, and it was plain that something
unusual was happening there. By the time
the boys had reached the rough little dock opposite
there were no &ldquo;geysers&rdquo; spouting, or other signs
of strenuous activity. But the three fishing boats
were clustered in a bunch, their occupants bending
over the sides busy attaching tackle to something
in the water which was invisible even through the
glass. Presently the engines started, the boats
separated, and headed for the dock.</p>
<p>The foremost chugged slowly and behind it
streaked the distinct wake of a heavy tow. On
tiptoe with excitement the boys watched eagerly
as it drew nearer and nearer. When at length a
great blue-gray shape could be made out, they set
up a shout and poured a volley of shrill questions
at the man in the stern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shark, all right,&rdquo; answered that individual
shortly. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen one of &rsquo;em around
these parts for years. He got caught in the net
and pretty near tore it to bits, drat him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with considerable heat and the other
two men were scowling. But to the scouts mere
damage to nets was as nothing compared with the
thrill of seeing the great creature close at hand.
They hovered around as close as Mr. Cartwright
would let them, and when the shark was finally
hoisted to the dock they were allowed to examine
it to their hearts&rsquo; content, take measurements,
make photographs or do anything else they chose.</p>
<p>The length of the creature from snout to tip
of tail was a little over fifteen feet, and the mouth,
though small and undershot, was powerful with
its double row of razor-like teeth. Even lying
there still and motionless, the body covered with
a score of wounds from boat hooks and an old
sword fish spear one of the men had fortunately
had aboard, it was an evil looking specimen. As
Steve Haddon thought of their experience of the
day before he could hardly suppress a shudder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, they ain&rsquo;t native to these parts, praise
be!&rdquo; said the fisherman to whom Cartwright was
talking. &ldquo;If they was we&rsquo;d about have to go out
of business. They breed in the south, but once in
a while one strays up this way. I dunno why.
Hungry, mebbe; or it might be jest accident.
Well, fellers, what say we get them nets in an&rsquo;
start repairin&rsquo; damages? We got a good two
days&rsquo; work ahead of us, hang the brute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naturally the capture of the shark affected the
swimming situation at camp. Mr. Wendell did not
at once remove his restrictions, but when a day
or so passed with no signs of any more about, he
relaxed the new rules a little. The scouts were
allowed to go in at the old place provided they did
not venture out too far. Two guards were also
appointed who rowed back and forth about a hundred
yards from shore, keeping a constant lookout
for danger.</p>
<p>Cavanaugh enjoyed these swimming periods extremely,
for though he made no complaint, he
found restriction to the camp limits very dull.
He had quite recovered his spirits and also a good
deal of that old good natured, easy air of leadership.
With Haddon, however, there was a
marked difference. He still joked and chaffed the
big, slow-speaking chap, but the chaff was all
good-natured now, with a subtle touch of affection
in it. Instead of Steve&rsquo;s making advances, it was
Cavvy who sought the other out, who moved his
seat at table, who found a place beside his friend
in the wide circle around the evening camp-fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>There was nothing forced or obtrusive in his
actions. He simply sought Haddon&rsquo;s companionship
in the direct, matter-of-fact manner he went
after anything he wanted, and yet he was not
selfish in his seeking. That, perhaps, was the
most marked feature of the moral change which
was taking place within him. In the old days if
he liked a fellow he was apt to monopolize him regardless
of the other&rsquo;s feelings in the matter.
Now, though Steve would have been perfectly content
to spend all his time within the camp limits
with Cavvy, the latter refused to allow it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No reason why you should stay cooped up here
just because I have to,&rdquo; he said one afternoon in
his quick, decisive manner. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve spent three
days hanging around doing nothing; it&rsquo;s time you
had a change. If you hustle you can get off with
that bunch fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t give a hang about fishing,&rdquo; protested
Haddon.</p>
<p>Cavvy grinned. &ldquo;Well, get a canoe, then, and
find someone to take a little exploring expedition
with you,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to write
letters and don&rsquo;t want to be bothered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Steve laughed, shrugged his shoulders and
walked away. He saw through his friend perfectly,
for Cavanaugh never wrote letters if he
could help it. But after all perhaps it would be
better for them to separate for the afternoon.
One can have too much of almost everything, and
Haddon had no wish to endanger the association
which meant so much to him.</p>
<p>He secured his canoe&mdash;it was the last one to
be had; but when it came to finding a companion,
all the fellows he particularly liked had departed
on other expeditions, so he decided to go alone.
He was an expert paddler and enjoyed it thoroughly.
He also liked poking about in new
places, and when he rounded the point and pushed
out into the Sound, he turned unhesitatingly westward.</p>
<p>Long Point thrust out its blunt nose from a
stretch of rather wild, deserted beach on the south
shore of the Cape. Amongst the sand dunes to
the eastward were a few fishermen&rsquo;s huts.
Several miles in the other direction lay the village
of Shelbourne, and beyond it, along both sides of
a wide estuary, sprawled the raw, staring buildings,
the many dry docks and numberless other
appurtenances of the big, new Government ship
building plant. But between the village and the
camp the shoreline cut abruptly inland for upwards
of a mile, forming a wide, deep harbor
which did much toward isolating the camp site
from the rest of the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Across the mouth of this harbor and reaching
well out into the Sound itself, there lay a multitude
of small islands, some mere jutting rocks to
which a few scraggly pines clung tenaciously,
others larger and thickly wooded. All of them
were steep and rocky, and between them the tide
rushed ceaselessly in queer, erratic, frequently
dangerous currents. It was a fine place for fish
of many sorts, but little more could be said for it,
though on one or two of the larger islands duck
shooters had put up rough huts which they used
in the late fall and early spring when the season
was on.</p>
<p>Steve had never happened to visit these islands.
He had, in fact, seen no more of them than was
visible from Shelbourne the day they made an inspection
of the shipyard over a week ago. And as
he headed the canoe toward the nearest one, he
looked forward with increasing eagerness to an
afternoon of exploration. They looked interesting,
and as he drew nearer he got attractive
glimpses of little coves and miniature harbors, of
wooded points, rocky slopes masked with green,
of turbulent, rushing channels, and a dozen other
features which thrilled him, and made him regret
his wasted opportunities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>The reality quite equalled his expectations.
He went from islet to islet, clambering about the
rocks, pushing through trees and undergrowth,
poking into everything to his heart&rsquo;s content.
There was a touch of the wilderness in it which
appealed to his imagination. It seemed, indeed, a
perfect paradise to the furred and feathered wild
things many of whom were heedless or oblivious
to his presence, and their presence added greatly
to his enjoyment.</p>
<p>It was already fairly late when he first saw the
great blue heron. It was later still when, having
followed the bird across the small island to the
edge of another&mdash;one of the largest of the group
he crouched amongst some bushes amusedly watching
the solemn, awkward, long-legged creature
stalking sedately away from him along a narrow
strip of beach.</p>
<p>Suddenly with a great whir and flapping of
wings, the heron arose and sailed out of sight.
At the same instant Steve was conscious of the
popping of a motor&rsquo;s exhaust coming rapidly
nearer, and turned curiously to see what it might
be.</p>
<p>Swiftly the boat came into sight, a dingy, unpainted
dory propelled by an auxiliary of unusual
power. In the stern sat a single figure, bare
headed and clad in rough fishing clothes. Almost
unconsciously, Steve had not emerged from the
bushes, and as the dory passed his hiding place
scarcely a dozen feet from him, he had for an instant
a clear, unrestricted view of the man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>He gave a start and frowned; raised himself
partway and then dropped back on his haunches.
The boat swept on and disappeared around a jutting
point, the sound of the motor grew rapidly
fainter&mdash;ceased. Still the boy crouched amongst
the bushes, staring blankly at the spot where the
craft had left his vision.</p>
<p>When he stood up a little later and moved
slowly toward his canoe, there was a puzzled,
troubled expression in his face. And in his narrowed
eyes was the look of one groping blindly
through his memory for something which he cannot
find.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">PERPLEXED</span></h2>
<p>A shout of laughter went up from the
group of fellows gathered in the cook
shack. There was a regular cook attached
to the camp, but every other evening supper
was prepared by the boys themselves as a
means of perfecting themselves in the culinary
art. Usually these occasions were marked by an
earnest seriousness, for there was great rivalry
between the various tents; but to-night a spirit of
levity undoubtedly prevailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why shouldn&rsquo;t he have been in the dory,
you old lobster?&rdquo; asked Billy McBride, from
where he bent over the frying pan.</p>
<p>Steve Haddon shrugged his bulky shoulders
and ran his fingers through an already much
towsled mop of brown hair. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly,
&ldquo;because he wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t what?&rdquo; demanded three or four voices,
as the big fellow paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he wasn&rsquo;t the sort of person who&rsquo;d be
in&mdash;in that sort of a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Another shout of laughter rang out. Jim
Cavanaugh, still chuckling, thumped Haddon on
the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certainly lucid, Steve,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Just what do you mean by that? What sort of
a person was he, anyhow? One of those swell
city guys who came down to fish, all dolled up in
dinky knickerbockers and that sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve was grinning good naturedly, but the
color had deepened faintly under his tan; he
shook his head slowly. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t dolled up at
all,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;He had on&mdash;well, just ordinary
old things; I didn&rsquo;t notice his clothes much.
He might have had a rod, though he wasn&rsquo;t fishing
when I saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he doing, then?&rdquo; asked Ted
Hinckley rather sharply. &ldquo;He must have been
doing something out of the way to set you against
him like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Haddon shook his head. The smile had
faded and his lips straightened into a firm line.
&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t doing anything except just running
the dory past that big island&mdash;Loon Island, I
think they call it,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t
understand, Ted. It&mdash;it was his face&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Hinckley laughed again, but not so uproariously
this time. During their ten days at camp together,
he as well as most of the others, had discovered
that while they could usually josh &ldquo;good
old Steve&rdquo; to the limit, a curious, stubborn tightening
of jaw and chin was a sign that this limit had
been reached. And because, for all their banter,
they liked him so well, they were generally quick
to notice and respect that sign as Hinckley did
now. His laughter trailed off into a comfortable
chuckle and he turned to assist the cook. Cavanaugh
flung one arm across Haddon&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you didn&rsquo;t like his face, eh?&rdquo; he smiled.
&ldquo;It must have been <i>some</i> face to work you up like
this, old man. What the dickens takes you so
long with those eggs, Micky? I&rsquo;m starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were mislaid, that&rsquo;s the trouble,&rdquo; returned
McBride without batting an eyelash.</p>
<p>A groan went up and one or two made as if
to lay violent hands upon the cook. But the responsibility
of his position saved him, and ten
minutes later the meal had been served up and
was being consumed with an appetite and dispatch
characteristic in a crowd of healthy, active boys
whose afternoon has been spent more or less
strenuously in the open. And as they ate they
kept up a running fire of josh and fun and banter
which flowed from most of them with the ease and
fluency of second nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>One of the exceptions was Steve Haddon. He
did not often joke, and when he assayed a pun it
had much the effect of an elephant trying to dance.
It wasn&rsquo;t that he lacked a sense of humor. He
thoroughly enjoyed the badinage which went on
about him, even when he himself, as was often the
case, became the butt for another&rsquo;s humor. But
he had never acquired the trick of answering back
in kind, and appeared always more or less deliberate
in thought and speech.</p>
<p>To-night, both at supper and later when they
had gathered around the camp fire, he was even
quieter than usual, for he was thinking about the
man he had seen that afternoon in the dory. He
realized that, with characteristic clumsiness of expression,
he had given the fellows an idea that
something about the man&rsquo;s face had prejudiced
him. As a matter of fact it wasn&rsquo;t so at all,
though he made no effort to correct himself. He
had had but a single good look at the stranger,
but that look was enough to rouse in the boy a
strong conviction that he had seen the man before&mdash;seen
him, too, under conditions and surroundings
so totally different that the stranger&rsquo;s
mere presence on this out of the way stretch of
New England coast seemed at once incongruous
and puzzling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>What those conditions had been he could not,
unfortunately, remember. Though he had tried
his best all the way back to camp to drag out of
his brain some further details of that former
meeting, Steve had failed utterly. That there
had been one he was quite certain. But how or
where or when it had taken place remained a
mystery. He felt, however, that it must have been
of the most casual sort, and also that it could
scarcely have taken place very recently, else
surely he would have remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely it was at home in Washington
some time,&rdquo; he thought, after they had settled
down lazily around the fire. &ldquo;Though it might
have been when I visited Uncle Joe in New York
last fall. Oh, hang it all. I&rsquo;m not going to bother
my head about it any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this was a resolution more easily made than
kept. For a short space Steve did succeed in detaching
his thoughts from the annoying puzzle.
Lying there on the sand with Cavvy&rsquo;s head pillowed
on his stomach, he grinned in silent appreciation
of Micky&rsquo;s airy monologue, and presently
began to hum under his breath the air
Champ Ferris was laboriously coaxing from a
much harassed guitar. Then, unconsciously, his
glance swept past the lounging figures of his
friends and out across the wide stretches of
shadowy water vaguely luminous under the stars.
Back of those shadows Loon Island lay, with all
the other rocky little islets that crowded the entrance
to Shelbourne harbor. And, perhaps, on
Loon Island&mdash;</p>
<p>Suddenly Steve awoke to a realization of where
his thoughts had carried him, and moved abruptly
with an impatient squirm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, boy, easy,&rdquo; murmured Cavvy drowsily.</p>
<p>Grinning shame-facedly, Steve reached down
and ruffled the other&rsquo;s hair. A perfunctory
scrimmage followed. But Cavanaugh was too
drowsy to carry this far. And very shortly Mr.
Wendell&rsquo;s orders sent the crowd staggering
sleepily tentwards.</p>
<p>A little later, crawling into his blankets, Steve
reached a sudden, abrupt decision. Since he
could not seem to rid his mind of the problem
which had been raised there, why not make an effort
to solve it? Very likely the answer would be
a simple one not worth his trouble, but at least
it would be an answer. Suppose he got another
look at the perplexing stranger? If he saw him
again that stubborn memory might awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a trip to Loon Island to-morrow,&rdquo; he
said to himself. Then he turned over and went
to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">LOON ISLAND</span></h2>
<p>Steve said nothing to anyone next day of
his determination. He knew he would be
laughed at, for he felt himself that it was
a rather foolish proceeding, and it would be difficult
or impossible for him to explain in words the
curious intensity of his interest in the matter. So
he did not even take Cavanaugh into his confidence,
merely explaining that he was going for
another little trip in the canoe. Cavvy&rsquo;s approval
was prompt, but there was just a touch of
disappointment in his manner which made Steve
a little troubled.</p>
<p>Was he making a fool of himself or not, he wondered,
as he slid out into the Sound from behind
the point. A portion of Loon Island was visible
now and he glanced speculatively in that direction.
For all he knew the stranger whose face
had so puzzled him might not be in the neighborhood
again for days or weeks. His presence
yesterday could easily have been the result of a
chance excursion never to be repeated. Nevertheless,
once started, he had no thought of giving
up the trip, for he was not the sort to turn
aside readily from something he had once set his
mind upon. So he dismissed his doubts and sent
the canoe forward resolutely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The surface of the Sound was smooth&mdash;almost
too smooth, in fact. There was an oily look to
the long, easy swells which rolled the canoe ever
so slightly as it cut across them. Once or twice
Steve glanced back and frowned a little at the
smoky, golden haze hugging the eastern horizon.
But he paddled steadily, keeping fairly close to
shore; and when he came opposite the group of
islands and headed his craft across the half-mile
stretch which separated the nearest one from
the mainland, the storm signals had not increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s going to hold off for a while,&rdquo; he
decided. &ldquo;Anyhow, at the worst I&rsquo;d be stuck
on the island over night&mdash;which wouldn&rsquo;t kill
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Presently he came abreast of the first little
islet and passed it, passed the next one, and then
turned into a narrow, rock-bordered channel
along the north side of Loon Island. The tide ran
swiftly here, but it carried him with it and without
much effort he managed to circle the lower
end of the island and reach the point where he
had landed the day before. Here he stepped
ashore, and pulling up the canoe, hid it in a thicket
of juniper. It was still fairly early&mdash;an hour and
a half earlier, in fact, than when Steve had
glimpsed the man in the dory yesterday afternoon.
But he had planned for this deliberately.
He wanted to take a look over the island before
returning to the point to watch for the stranger.</p>
<p>Back of the point the rocks rose steeply, with
stunted pines, scrub oak and a tangle of scraggly
bushes growing from every conceivable crevice
and earth-pocket. It was far from easy going,
but Steve pushed his way through the undergrowth
with only an occasional pause, keeping as
close to the shore as possible.</p>
<p>Presently he came upon a gully, slid into
it, climbed the other side and finally, pushing
through a grove of wind-tossed trees, stepped
out into a narrow, open space. Then he paused
abruptly.</p>
<p>On either hand steep, smooth masses of rock
jutted up, shutting in the place completely. Less
than a score of yards apart, they shelved down
into the water, forming a tiny, sheltered cove
toward which the ground sloped gently. It was
a snug spot, shielded from storms, and also from
observation, and a rough shack of weathered
boards seemed a natural part of the gray, rock-strewn
landscape. But Steve had not been expecting
to find a hut here, and his first thought
as he stared at it, motionless and a little tense,
was to connect it, somehow with the man he was
seeking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>For several minutes he stood there alert, his
glance fixed curiously and intently on the cabin.
It was one of the duck shooters&rsquo; huts, no doubt,
of which the boys had told him. It must have
stood there for some time, too, judging from the
dingy, weathered look of the planking. But it
seemed odd, with the duck season so far away,
that the shutter of the single small window at
the rear should be swinging open. Surely any
one leaving it for a year or more would have made
things more secure against intrusion.</p>
<p>Steve waited a little longer, turning over various
possibilities in his mind, and then moved
slowly forward. The stillness of the place,
coupled with a certain instinct hard to define,
made him feel that the shack was at the moment
unoccupied. When he reached the window and
looked in, he found that instinct had served him
well. The place was empty, and after a brief
survey, he moved around to the front and opened
the door, which was merely on the latch. Instantly
his eyes fell upon a raw, splintered spot
where a lock had been and he bent to examine it
closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;I thought so. Somebody&rsquo;s
broken in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Thoughtfully he straightened up and looked
around. There was little doubt in his mind as
to who had made the forcible entry, but the object
of it was as great a puzzle as the identity of
the mysterious stranger. And presently he discovered
that there was more than one in the marauding
party.</p>
<p>In each of the four rough bunks at one end of
the cabin were blankets. Also, scattered over
the rude plank table in the middle of the room,
were four tin plates and as many cups, all of
which had been lately used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no place for me,&rdquo; decided Steve as he
took in these details. &ldquo;If they should come back
and find me here, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words clipped off and he whirled about
with widening eyes as the muffled beat of an
engine&rsquo;s exhaust smote suddenly on his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimminy!&rdquo; he gasped, and leaped for the door.</p>
<p>He was half way through it when he saw the
bow of a dory sliding into view past the rocks at
the end of the cove. Jumping back like a flash,
he jerked the door shut and latched it noiselessly.
For an instant he hesitated, heart pounding in
his throat. Then he moved swiftly to the window,
pulled himself up, squeezed through and plunged
into the fringe of undergrowth about a dozen
feet away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>But as he gained the shelter he realized that
the popping of the engine had ceased and he heard
the sound of voices. He dared not pause here,
but sped on over the rough ground. It was not
the same way he had come, but he cared nothing
for that. The closeness of his escape had shaken
him considerably, and he was trembling. It was
not until he had pushed through the woods for a
hundred feet or more that he began to slow down
and recover himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a nut I am!&rdquo; he muttered, wiping his
forehead with the back of one hand. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
never come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, being what he was, he grew angry at
himself for that panicky flight. If he had stayed
at the edge of the woods he might have had a
good look at the stranger without any special
risk. He might even have gained some hint as
to what the party was doing here. He had just
about decided to turn and retrace his steps, when
he stumbled and almost fell, saving himself only
by a quick snatch at an overhanging branch.
Then, looking down to discover what had tripped
him, he saw the tins!</p>
<p>At first glance, indeed, they did not look like
tins, but more like square, rectangular boxes
covered with canvas. It was only by pressing
one with his fingers that he felt the distinctive
give of thin metal. There were a dozen or more
in all, piled neatly in a cavity among the rocks and
covered over with leaves and dead branches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Filled with curiosity, Steve punched and
prodded the top one inquiringly and ran his fingers
exploringly over its surface. He was on
the point of lifting it to test the weight, when the
sound of voices behind him brought him upright
with a gasp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">THE LIGHTNING FLASH</span></h2>
<p>For the barest second Haddon stood listening.
Then he bent down again and made
a frantic, scrambling effort to cover the
tins. But as the voices came steadily nearer and
the scuffling of feet began to sound in the dead
leaves, he abandoned the attempt and darting a
few steps to one side flung himself down behind
a thick, low-growing mass of laurel. In a space
so brief that he felt they must have heard him,
the bushes were thrust aside and the footsteps
ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;a rabbit, I guess, or maybe a bird,&rdquo; said a
voice. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t matter, anyway. Here&rsquo;s the
stuff, half uncovered, too. Hang that Peters!
I told him to&mdash; Here, catch hold, will you? We
haven&rsquo;t much time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want it in the boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! The chief is going to leave in about
an hour. We&rsquo;ll land at Cobb&rsquo;s Point and wait
there till dark. Here&rsquo;s a couple for you, Jansen.
We&rsquo;ll take the rest in another trip.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Flat on the ground behind the laurel clump,
Steve listened intently to their departing footsteps.
Not daring to stir, he had failed to get
even a glimpse of the three men, but he missed no
word of their brief conversation which left him
in a state of bewildered doubt and speculation.
He could make nothing out of it at all. What
was in those tins? and why were they being
taken secretly to Cobb&rsquo;s Point, that lonely strip
of sand dunes the other side of Shelbourne?</p>
<p>As he lay there waiting, a good many possibilities
flashed through the boy&rsquo;s mind. He could
not rid himself of the feeling that the men were
up to nothing good. Yet on the other hand he
realized that even the broken door and the hidden
tins might have some harmless explanation.
There was a fish hatchery, for instance, at Shelbourne,
and it came upon him with a sudden sense
of chagrin, that he had seen the young fish shipped
from there in just such tins as these.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the feeling of suspicion remained
uppermost, even though the men, on their second
trip, let fall no enlightening words. When they
finally departed, he emerged from hiding, a look
of determination on his square jawed face, and
headed for the spot where he had left the canoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>At least it was in his power to follow up the
matter if he chose; and he did choose. He knew
where they were going, and he knew Cobb&rsquo;s
Point. He could reach it before they did, and
by concealing himself among the dunes, he might
get a chance not only to glimpse again the face
of the man he so wished to see, but also to learn
something further of the party&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p>As he hurried along, Steve realized that
through the woods shadows were deepening on
every hand, while in the glades and open spots
the light had a curious greenish-saffron tint that
urged him to his utmost speed. Emerging finally
on the shore he saw that there was no time to
lose. The sun had disappeared. Above him the
sky glowed with an unnatural light, while piled up
in the east were great banks of black, ragged
looking clouds.</p>
<p>For a moment Steve hesitated, measuring with
his eye the distance of those clouds. Then he
dragged out the canoe, dropped it hastily into the
water, climbed in and thrust away from shore.
Among the islands the current was swift, but even
there he did not spare his paddle. And every
little while he glanced backwards apprehensively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>As he left the shelter of the islands and faced
a mile-wide stretch of open water, the cloud-bank
was half way up from the horizon with long,
ragged streamers stretching out before it. He
thrust his paddle deep and sent the canoe leaping
across the oily swells; but like the tentacles
of an octopus, those cloud streamers seemed to
reach after him, dragging the black, ominous bulk
behind. Half a mile he made, the sweat standing
out on his face, his breath coming in gasps.
Another quarter mile. He was paddling with
every scrap of strength and skill he had, yet
the clouds were overhead now, reaching out and
onward inexorably.</p>
<p><a id="rfront" href="#front">A hundred yards from shore he hazarded a backward glance</a>
and saw the wind sweeping
across the bay, a line of turbulent, tossing spray.
It caught him with incredible swiftness, hurled
the canoe forward, whirled it about, and before
Steve could realize what was happening, he found
himself struggling in the water.</p>
<p>He lost his paddle, but managed to retain a
grip on the canoe, and swimming in a sort of
daze, he finally dragged himself and it ashore.
There, utterly done up, he flung himself face
downward on the sand and lay for he knew not
how long, drawing in the air in long, gasping
gulps.</p>
<p>At length, still panting, he raised his head and
slowly gained his feet. The surface of the bay
was torn into a sea of angry, tossing whitecaps.
The wind shrieked past him, driving gusts of fine
spray into his face. Darkness was falling fast,
relieved now and again by a vivid flash of lightning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Uncertain whether the men would venture
across in the teeth of the storm, Steve felt that
if they did make the attempt they might appear
at any moment. So he made haste to drag the
canoe back of a mass of beach grass.</p>
<p>It was as well he did. Scarcely had he flung
himself down beside the upturned keel and
hunched his shoulders against the driving rain
which had begun to pelt him, when out of the
curtain of mist and shadow the dory flashed suddenly
into his startled consciousness. He heard
nothing of the engine; the shrieking of the wind
and the first rattle of thunder drowned every sound.
He simply saw, by the aid of the lightning
and his straining vision, the bow of the
dory, billows of foam spreading out on either
side, cleaving the waves not fifty feet from shore.
In another moment he heard the crunch and grating
of the boat beaching, followed by a confused
mingling of voices.</p>
<p>It was not yet absolutely dark and by this time
his eyes were accustomed to the scene. Presently
he could make out a number of shadowy figures
bunched together and bending over. They were
dragging the dory up the beach; he could tell
that by their strained attitudes and their slow
approach. Nearer they came to the screen of
grass and nearer still, for not so much by chance
as from the extreme narrowness of the point, they
had landed at almost the same spot as Steve.
Now he could make out the party quite clearly,
black silhouettes against the grayish black of the
sea behind them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>They had halted now, not half a dozen feet
from his hiding place, and were bending over the
dory taking out the tins. Their backs were
toward him, but as Steve lay there blinded by
the flashes of lightning and deafened by the rolls
of thunder, he felt, somehow, that on the contents
of those tins hung the solution of his mystery.
If he could only find out that, and the
identity of the man who had drawn him hither,
he would know something of where he stood.</p>
<p>Though he could distinguish nothing save their
outlines, his eyes had not left the four men for an
instant. He even raised himself a little and
parted the screen of beach grass in an effort to
keep track of their movements. Presently he
saw that they had straightened up. Apparently
they had removed all the tins, and he wondered
eagerly what would be the next step. Then, of
a sudden, as they stood there, another jagged
fork of light flashed through the dark storm
clouds, and Steve caught his breath and narrowly
escaped crying out in sheer amazement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>The blinding glare showed him two of the men
erect and partly facing him; but it did more than
that. It awakened memory at last. And as the
blackness settled down again, thick and stifling,
the rain, the wind, the whole wild, storm-swept
strip of coast vanished. The darkness remained,
but it was the tempered darkness of a street in
Washington the night of that thrilling day over
a year ago&mdash;the day after the declaration of war.
Back of some iron palings loomed the outlines of
the German embassy. Beside the curb stood a
limousine from which two men had just alighted.
As Steve, hurrying home from a belated engagement,
came opposite them, their faces were illumined
brilliantly for a moment by the glare of
a passing headlight. One of those men was the
German Ambassador himself. The other&mdash;</p>
<p>No wonder Steve Haddon had almost betrayed
himself at what that lightning flash revealed.
No wonder he asked himself breathlessly, excitedly,
what sinister business could have brought
that other&mdash;here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">THE PLOT</span></h2>
<p>Mechanically Steve put up one hand
and brushed away the water that
trickled down from his soaked hair.
He was wet to the skin, but he fairly tingled all
over with the thrill of his discovery. He was
not mistaken; he could not be. That mental picture
was much too clear to admit any doubt.</p>
<p>He was still ignorant of the man&rsquo;s actual identity.
But his presence with the ambassador that
night, the friendly touch of the latter&rsquo;s hand upon
his shoulder, the earnest undertone of their conversation
carried on in German, all pointed to
an unusual degree of intimacy. And many
months ago the ambassador, his staff and all his
other associates, official and otherwise, were supposed
to have left the country or to be safely
interned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>This one had evidently escaped the net. Steve
wasted no time speculating how he had done it,
or where he had spent the intervening time. He
was a spy, doing a spy&rsquo;s work; everything
pointed to that. His objective must be the shipyard,
too, for there was nothing else worth destroying
within a score of miles. Inwardly Haddon
bitterly blamed his own stupidity in not having
thoughts of that before. The tins contained
powerful explosive, no doubt; enough, perhaps,
to blow up both buildings and dry docks. They
had planned the thing with their usual infernal
care, waiting, perhaps for this very night of
storm and blackness to make the attempt doubly
sure. And they would succeed, the boy told himself
with a dry sob of mingled rage and nervousness,
unless he could outwit them.</p>
<p>He ground his teeth in helpless fury. He ought
to be up and away immediately to carry the warning.
But the plotters were so close that he could
scarcely stir without detection. There was a
chance that by edging back cautiously he might
safely reach a point where he could take to his
heels, but so much depended on him that he dared
not risk it. He must wait until they moved away
a little and then, by speeding down the opposite
side of the point, he might gain the mainland
and the shipyard ahead of them and give the
alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Presently another lightning flash showed up
the group again, and Steve&rsquo;s eyes widened in
astonishment. Instead of four men there were
six. Where the other two had come from he
did not know, but it seemed as if they must have
made their way out along the beach. So he was
faced by a new difficulty. There might be others
still, stationed along the way, and if he tried to
reach the shipyard ahead of the gang, he was as
likely as not to run straight into hostile arms.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he meant to try it, for by this
time he was desperate with anxiety and impatience.
He was about to creep back without
further waiting, when suddenly there came one
of those curious lulls which occur sometimes at
the very height of a storm. Abruptly the shriek
of the wind died down and he could hear the
voices clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;all in the guard house. As long as the
storm holds there won&rsquo;t be a soul around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the rain!&rdquo; put in another voice with a
harsh, guttural accent. &ldquo;Will not that eggtinguish
the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this fire,&rdquo; returned another confidently,
and Steve recognized one of the voices he had
overheard that afternoon. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t enough
water up above to drown this stuff once she gets
started. Besides, it&rsquo;s letting up. By the time we
get things going it won&rsquo;t be more than a drizzle;
and if the wind holds the whole shebang will go up
in smoke. What we want is to get busy
right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The rest was inaudible, scattered by the storm,
which broke out again with a fresh strength.
But Steve had heard enough. Fire, then, was to
be their weapon, and not explosives. The tins
must contain gasoline, or some even more powerful
inflammable. But it made little difference in
the result, for the destruction would be as great
or greater. With sudden decision the boy made
up his mind to delay no longer.</p>
<p>His every muscle tense, he waited impatiently
for the next flash. The instant it had come and
gone, he began to edge backward, slowly, silently,
with infinite care, over the wet, yielding sand.
It took a long time to worm past the length of
the canoe, but after that he made better progress.
At length, a hundred feet or more from the end
of the point and on the opposite side, he rose to
his feet and hurried along the beach toward the
mainland.</p>
<p>Anyone who has tried walking in the dark will
realize something of his difficulties. Actually
Steve could not see his hand before his face, and
he had not gone twenty feet before he found himself
splashing in the water. He edged away from
that and presently tripped and almost fell over a
hummock of beach grass. Then, very swiftly, all
sense of direction left him. His only guidance
was the splash of waves about his ankles and the
tingle of salt spray against his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>It was a nightmare, that blind struggle through
the storm; a nightmare of pelting, lashing rain,
of stumbling, falling, wading through surf, of
pounding over hard sand. And like a nightmare
little things grew big and big things little; time
seemed to stand still or stretch out into infinity.
Worst of all was the blackness, thick and suffocating,
that pressed upon his eyeballs and tangled
about his feet. And behind that blackness there
was fear. Not fear for self so much; he was past
that now. The thing that dominated and urged
him on, that kept him going in spite of weariness
and doubt and panting breath, was fear lest he
should be too late to reach his goal before the
others. And in the end he was too late!</p>
<p>His first inkling of it was the sight of those
three spots of light twinkling low over to the left.
At first they meant nothing to his weary brain.
Then, watching them dazedly, he realized all at
once that they were electric flashlights, and with
a sudden, bitter pang he understood.</p>
<p>The men were almost opposite him, moving
rapidly along the other side of Cobb&rsquo;s Point,
which here was some two hundred yards across.
Unhampered by the darkness, they had caught
up to him, were really ahead of him, in fact, for
Steve had to cross the base of the point to reach
the shipyard a mile or more to the westward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>With a discouraged droop to his shoulders, the
boy plodded on mechanically for a little way and
then halted. The spots of light had suddenly
shifted. He could still make out a faint, luminous
glow, but it was obscured by moving shadows.
And then it came to him that for some minutes
past he had felt no water sloshing around his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the mainland,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
left the point and turned up the other shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no time for caution and delay, and Steve
went after them at once. Though his attempt to
reach the shipyard first had failed, there was still
a chance, though not nearly so sure, of gaining
his end by following close behind the plotters and
giving the alarm before they had time to carry
out the details of their plan.</p>
<p>In the brief interval of waiting a number of
other possibilities had flashed through his mind,
only to be discarded. He might make his way
back to Shelbourne and get help. There was a
good road leading through the woods from the
village which was used by workmen going to and
from their quarters; a motor car could make the
distance in five minutes. But Shelbourne was
quite as far from Cobb&rsquo;s Point as the shipyard,
and there were sure to be delays in rousing people
and getting out a car. He thought, too, of pushing
straight through the woods from where he was
and trying to hit that road, but the chances of
getting lost in even that short stretch of scrub
and tangled undergrowth were too great to be
risked. The open beach was really the only sure
way, and Steve took it without hesitation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>With stumbling, uncertain steps he felt his way
across the point and gained the other shore. Far,
far ahead of him, it seemed, wavered the faint
glow of the flashlights, and their apparent distance
startled him. He had planned to follow as
close behind the plotters as he dared; it had not
occurred to him that they might outdistance him
altogether. With a sharp catching of his breath,
he plunged forward and began to run. A moment
later the lights blinked out abruptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">THROUGH STORM AND DARKNESS</span></h2>
<p>Steve fell twice and a thorny branch lashed
him across the face with painful force before
he got the better of that panicky dash.
One of two things must have happened. Either
the flashlights had been extinguished, or else the
men had passed around a bend which hid the
sight of them from view. The latter was perhaps
the more likely; but it was the possibility that
they had heard him and were lurking ahead in
the darkness, awaiting his approach, that turned
him cold.</p>
<p>It was the first time his nerve had been really
shaken, but it was shaken now. The darkness or
the plotters, taken separately, he could face
without tremors. It was the combination of the
two, the combination of the unknown, the unseen,
the suspense of uncertainty, which made him
shiver and brought out a clammy perspiration
on his forehead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>It set him to thinking, also, of the camp and
wishing with a desperate sort of longing for the
presence of some of the fellows to back him up.
If only Cavvy were here, with his cool head and
ready wit; his sturdy fearlessness would be a
tower of strength. Why, even little Shrimp
Willett would be a comfort.</p>
<p>But they were all back there in camp with lights
and warmth and cheerfulness about them, while
he was here&mdash;alone. And he must go forward
alone, too, no matter what that beastly blackness
held in store for him. He dug his teeth into his
under lip. Then his chin went up abruptly.</p>
<p>What had got into him? What was he thinking
of? Why, at this very instant men were facing
with a smile things a thousand times worse than
this. Black wastes of shell-torn barrenness,
tangled with barbed wire, littered with unknown
pitfalls, loomed into his imagination. There were
shadows brightened ominously by the flare of
signal rockets or the flash of hand grenades; silences
shattered by the thunder of big guns or the
whining ping of sharpshooters&rsquo; bullets. And in
imagination that worst horror of all&mdash;the deadly
poison gas&mdash;caught him for an instant by the
throat and choked him. Yet over there men
looked hourly into the face of such a death and
laughed, while he was afraid to take a little risk&mdash;for
them!</p>
<p>A burning flush flamed into the boy&rsquo;s face and
he clenched his hands spasmodically. From his
lips came a sound of mingled shame and fury and
determination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a cur I am!&rdquo; he grated scornfully.
&ldquo;What a beastly coward to be downed by a little
dark and wet! And I won&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubt and hesitation thrown aside, he sped on
along the beach. Once or twice the thought of
what might be waiting for him slipped past that
mental barrier of resolution, but he flung it fiercely
back. And when he had gone two hundred yards
or so he began to breathe more easily. They
could scarcely have been much further off than
this when the lights vanished. Another hundred
yards and he was quite certain. It was impossible
in the darkness to tell where the shoreline
curved, but he had a feeling that it must be about
this point. A few minutes later the faint, distant
gleam of light ahead confirmed his guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that stupid fuss about nothing,&rdquo; he
growled. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s up to me to catch up with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though he did his best, he was still a hundred
yards behind when, as nearly as he could
guess, they reached the wide estuary of the shipyard.
There was a dock here where supplies and
materials were landed, and from it a well-used
road led through the regular lines of store houses,
machine shops and countless other buildings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Almost at the edge of this road the lights winked
out again, but this time Haddon felt no uneasiness.
Though it was still blowing hard, the rain had
lessened noticeably. Some of the guards, more
zealous than the rest, might venture forth, and
the twinkle of strange lights would inevitably
raise an alarm.</p>
<p>Steve paused for an instant and stared ahead,
trying to penetrate the darkness. To his right,
among the buildings, a few scattered electric
lights shone obscurely, but they did little toward
relieving the general gloom. Slipping along from
shadow to shadow, the plotters would have no
difficulty in gaining any part of the yard they
chose for their incendiary purpose. But this same
condition was a corresponding aid to him.</p>
<p>Having visited the yard, he knew the general
direction of the guard house. Now, when the men
ahead vanished into the gloom, Steve turned
abruptly to his right across an open space of recently
cleared land. He found it far from easy
going. There were stumps and roots to trip him
up; hollows and other pitfalls to avoid. With the
spies so near, a fall or even a noisy stumble might
ruin everything. But the boy crept on, feeling
his way forward, chafing at the sense of precious
minutes flying, until the dark bulk of the first
building loomed before him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Speeding a little, he passed along the rear of
it, crossed a slightly brighter space, and gained
the shadow of the next one. But as he reached
the further corner a sound, slight yet unmistakeable,
brought him to a sudden halt, breathless and
tingling. The sound was the faint splintering of
wood, and close upon its heels came the noise of a
window being slowly lifted. With nerves like
taut-strung wires, Steve crept forward and peered
around the corner.</p>
<p>In front of the third building in the row hung
one of the temporary electric globes that were
dotted sparsely over the shipyard. At this distance
it served merely to lighten the gloom a
trifle. But Haddon, staring intently into the
shadows, presently made out one which seemed
darker than the rest&mdash;a shadow that moved
slightly, to merge a moment later into the blacker
darkness of an open window.</p>
<p>Just a second the boy stood petrified. From
the first it had been his plan not alone to prevent
the catastrophe, but to try and bring about a capture
of the plotters. But the sight of one of them
actually entering the building shocked him to a
realizing sense of how much more vital it was to
prevent the fire from getting headway. In a flash
he had left his hiding and headed for the guard
house on the run.</p>
<p>Racing across the open space between the two
buildings he sped through the shadows back of the
third one, circled it, and gained the open road.
Instinctively he kept to the darker side of this.
The padding of his sodden shoes made scarcely
any sound on the hard dirt, and there was a chance
that he might escape detection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Presently the lighted windows of the guards&rsquo;
bunk house loomed ahead like a beacon. There
was a swift, final spurt along the silent, deserted
road, a nervous, backward glance which revealed
only the placid darkness unlighted by the sinister
glare he feared. Then he gained the steps,
stumbled up them, and flung open the door which
yielded to his touch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">HIS BIT</span></h2>
<p>For a moment Steve leaned panting against
the door, blinking in the glare of the long,
brightly lighted room. He was conscious
of dozen faces turning toward him, and of a man
in khaki rising swiftly from a table close at hand.
In that first instant he could not seem to find his
voice, but his sodden, dripping, mud-caked figure,
his white face, streaked across one cheek with red,
his wide, dilated eyes, evidently were eloquent,
almost, as speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; snapped the man, moving quickly
toward him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; gulped Haddon thickly. &ldquo;Six men&mdash;out
there&mdash;&rdquo; he waved one arm. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got
cans of gasoline&mdash;or something. I followed them&mdash;from
Loon Island. They&rsquo;re spies. I&mdash;heard
them plotting to&mdash;burn the yard.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A babel of exclamations drowned his voice.
There was a noisy scrape of many chair-legs.
As the men leaped up, cards dropped from laxed
fingers and fluttered to the floor. A chair fell
backwards with a crash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;A plot to burn the yard!&rdquo; gasped the man
before him. His face paled beneath the tan; then
flushed. Across one temple a tiny vein began to
throb. &ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be so! Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, I tell you!&rdquo; cried the boy desperately.
&ldquo;I heard them planning it. The leader&rsquo;s
a German spy. I saw him with von Bernstorff
in Washington a year ago. One of them&rsquo;s already
broken into a building down the road.
Unless you hurry it will be too late. You <i>must</i>
believe me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stared silently at him for an instant,
one hand mechanically gripping the butt of a Colt
that swung at his hip. Then he whirled around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get busy, fellows,&rdquo; he ordered with crisp decisiveness.
&ldquo;It may be a false alarm, but the kid
seems pretty sure of his facts.&rdquo; He turned to
Steve again. &ldquo;Which building is it? Third
from the dock on the left? Good. The rest of
&rsquo;em may be anywhere. Charley, take eight men
and slip along by the dry docks. Look into every
shop, but don&rsquo;t waste time. The rest of you come
with me. Switch on the search lights, Dick.
Hold up, though. Wait about three minutes and
then throw the switch. That&rsquo;ll give us time to
spread around. Hustle, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>The admonition seemed scarcely necessary.
Before he had ceased speaking each man had
seized a rifle, buckled on a revolver and stood
ready. Except for that first moment of startled
surprise, there had been no stir or tumult. They
were well disciplined and apparently realized the
need for speed and caution, for when the leader
issued forth, they followed him silently and
swiftly.</p>
<p>Like twin lines of phantoms, the two squads
glided into the open and sped away to their positions.
It was as if they meant to make up now
for the relaxed vigilance which had made this danger
possible. Without a word the smaller body
disappeared into the darkness toward the water
front, and at a whispered command two men hurried
off to take their stand at the limits of the
yard nearest the village. The remainder, under
the leader whose name was Kelly, scattered among
the buildings to the left of the road.</p>
<p>Steve went with this party and presently found
himself with Kelly and another man speeding toward
the building near the end of the row which
he had seen the spy enter. From a broken sentence
or two he learned that the system of search
lights had just been installed, but not formally
received from the contractor, and hence had not
been turned on. That explained the first darkness
of the yard. But there was little time for
conversation and there was to be even less. For
as they dashed up to the front of the building,
the windows which before had been mere patches
of blackness were sharply outlined now with the
lurid, flickering glow of fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>A savage snarl came from Kelly&rsquo;s throat and
he leaped for the door, master key in hand. The
other man ran past him, pulled up at the corner,
and yanked out his gun. Twice it spat fire, the
echoes of the shots crashing through the silent
yard with sharp distinctness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him?&rdquo; snapped Kelly, flinging open the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; was the grim reply.</p>
<p>But it passed unheeded. Steve himself only
recalled it afterward; for as the door swung open
a cloud of smoke belched forth and behind it they
could see a leaping, quivering wall of flame. At
almost the same instant there came a blinding
flash and the whole yard was bathed suddenly in
a flood of clear, white light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The extinguisher, Joe&mdash;quick!&rdquo; grated Kelly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to stop it before this wind takes
hold.&rdquo; He whirled on Steve. &ldquo;Chase back to
the bunkhouse, kid, and tell Dick to start the
pumps and sound the alarm. Run!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Steve ran, and long afterwards he had only to
close his eyes to bring back every detail of that
strange scene&mdash;for it was strange beyond description.
The search lights had come on, and the wide
road flanked with buildings was as brilliant as
the busy street of any city, but as silent as the
grave and as empty of any signs of life. And yet,
to the boy, that surface emptiness and silence
fairly pulsed with life&mdash;vivid, vital, elemental life,
which might flame up, white hot, at any instant
like the fire of a volcano bursting its thin crust
of ashes. And as he ran Steve waited tingling,
almost breathless, for that outbreak.</p>
<p>It came just as he reached the bunkhouse steps&mdash;a
pistol shot, sharp and snapping. There was
another and another still, and out of the tail of
his eye he glimpsed indistinctly the swift dash
of some figures past the rear of a building across
the road. Racing up the steps, Steve panted out
his message. In a moment more the piercing
wail of a siren screamed shrilly through the night,
followed quickly by the dull throbbing of machinery.</p>
<p>Back in the road again, the boy paused for an
instant, his heart beating fast with excitement.
The sense of empty quiet had vanished utterly.
Above him, from the engine-house stack, the high,
piercing note of the siren rose and fell shrieking
a clamorous warning. From somewhere in the
yard a rifle shot came sharply to his ears. Ahead
of him several guards were thudding down the
road towards the clouds of red-tinged smoke
which poured from the burning building with increasing
volume.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>He ran a few steps in that direction, slowed
down for a lagging second or two, spurted again,
and ducked around the corner of a big machine
shop on the left of the road a little below the guard
house. Back of this ran the completed portion
of a high board fence topped with barbed wire
which would ultimately encircle the entire yard.
A moment before he had glimpsed, slipping along
that fence, the figure of a man whose furtive movements
roused instant suspicion. He might just
possibly be one of the guards, but to Steve, remembering
the three he had seen running that
same way a little while before, it seemed much
more likely that he was one of the spies heading
for the end of the fence and freedom.</p>
<p>There was little time to think or plan or be
afraid. It was pure instinct which sent him flying
to cut the creature off&mdash;instinct, and a consuming
fury against the treachery of these
villains. He reached the rear of the building at
almost the same instant of his quarry. There was
no pause, no word; only a sob of exulting recognition
jolted from Steve&rsquo;s lips as the whole weight
of his solid bone and muscle struck the fellow and
they went down together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>In falling, he gripped the man about the body.
Almost instantly he realized that his hands were
more than full. The play of steel muscles beneath
his fingers told him that much, even before those
furious writhings began, or the fierce blows which
fell upon his head and shoulders. Twice his
hoarse cry for help rang out before he ducked
his head defensively under the other&rsquo;s arm, and
tightened the clutch of interlacing fingers against
the hollow of the fellow&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Blows began to fall upon his neck and shoulders,
fierce, heavy blows that shook his whole body and
jolted the wind in gasps through his clenched
teeth. The man heaved up almost to his full
height, dragging the boy by sheer strength over
yards of roughstones and stubble, but still he
failed to loose that grip. Something sharp like
the upturned spike in a forgotten piece of planking
tore through Steve&rsquo;s clothes and bit deeply
into his thigh; his face, scraped by the rough
pressure against the man&rsquo;s coat, burned like fire.
But he hung on doggedly in spite of pain and
weariness and failing breath.</p>
<p>Then came a blow upon his neck, a cruel, dazing
blow which made his senses reel and brought
tears of pain into his eyes. Would they never
come? he wondered dully. He could not strike
back without loosening his hold. He tried to
move his head a little to protect his neck, but
again that iron fist beat down on his quivering
flesh and wrenched from him a moan of agony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>His senses swam; he felt his muscles laxing.
Now searching fingers slid across his shrinking
neck and clutched his throat. Before the choking
grip had tightened a muffled cry of pain and dull
fury burst from him&mdash;a cry which, even to his
dazed brain, seemed strangely echoed and prolonged.
Then came an instant winking out of
everything. When consciousness returned he
could breathe again, but persistent hands were
busy prying loose the grip of his cramped fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; he panted stubbornly.
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, boy, easy!&rdquo; said a roughly soothing
voice. &ldquo;Let go, son; it&rsquo;s all right now. We&rsquo;ve
got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s muscles relaxed instinctively, and as
the spy&rsquo;s body was drawn from his grasp, his
bruised shoulders dropped back wearily against
a supporting knee. Blinking, he stared upward
at a vaguely familiar face bending over him. It
was a moment or two before he recognized it as
the face of the guard called Dick. Two others
stood nearby and between them sagged the body
of the prisoner, whose limpness proclaimed no
gentle handling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him&mdash;get away,&rdquo; murmured Steve.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s the leader of the bunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear, son,&rdquo; Dick assured him grimly.
Then his face changed. &ldquo;Are you hurt bad?&rdquo;
he asked anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>A crooked smile twisted the boy&rsquo;s lips, and he
shook his head. &ldquo;Not&mdash;much,&rdquo; he said slowly.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get up&mdash;in a second. Did&mdash;did the fire
get away from them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; answered the big guard. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
fighting it hard. At the worst it&rsquo;ll take only the
two buildings to windward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slid an arm around Haddon and lifted him
to his feet, supporting him carefully as they
moved slowly back to the road. &ldquo;Pure grit,&rdquo;
he remarked over one shoulder. &ldquo;The beast had
him near murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faint flush crept up into Steve&rsquo;s face, but he
was not thinking of the praise, though this meant
much to him. His mind had leaped a gap of many
thousand miles; and in imagination he saw a battered
band of men in khaki returning from a
foray. Again that twisted smile curved his dry
lips. He was not one of them&mdash;might never be.
But he had done his best for them, and in his
heart there glowed a sudden sense of humble
comradeship which was its own reward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">THE LAST NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Back on the main thoroughfare of the shipyard,
Steve stared about him with widening
eyes. How could he ever have
thought the place quiet or empty he wondered?
The siren still wailed shrilly from the engine
stack. But added to it now was the dull, hoarse
clamor of many voices rising and falling, the
roar and clatter of arriving motor cars, the thud
of hurrying feet.</p>
<p>Along the road as far as he could see ranged
a long line of empty automobiles, and fresh ones
were constantly arriving. Workmen and mechanics
belonging to the yard, fishermen from
Shelbourne, farmers from the surrounding
country who had heard and answered the alarm,
poured from the cars and were marshalled into
line and sent to the danger points by a file of
soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where on earth did they come from?&rdquo; the
boy asked, staring at the latter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Major Whitcomb&rsquo;s bunch,&rdquo; explained
Dick. &ldquo;He got here about five minutes ago and
took charge. Come ahead in; he&rsquo;ll want to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve was about to protest, but remembering
that he would probably have to tell his story sometime,
he gave way with a shrug. Dick pushed
through the throng, followed by the two guards
with their prisoner. A moment later the group
halted before a big table in the bunk house behind
which sat the officer who had charge of constructing
the shipyard. He answered Dick&rsquo;s
salute smartly; then Steve caught the gimlet
stare from a pair of cool gray eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two more?&rdquo; the officer questioned curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; only one,&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;This
is the lad who brought us warning of the plot
He&rsquo;s just caught the fellow, here, who he says is
leader of the whole gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major Whitcomb&rsquo;s face changed abruptly.
The gray eyes softened a bit, and under the crisp
mustache his lips laxed something of their sternness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just the one I want to see, then,&rdquo; he
said in a friendly voice. &ldquo;You look done up, too.
Bring a chair and sit down here. Sergeant, take
this man in charge and don&rsquo;t let him out of your
sight. Now,&rdquo; he added when Steve had brought
over a chair, and dropped down in it, &ldquo;tell me
all about it. Who are you? and how did you get
mixed up in this business?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Steve obeyed, telling his story as briefly and as
clearly as he could. The officer listened intently,
making an occasional note and asking many questions.
When Haddon had finished, the man bent
forward and clapped him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was splendidly done, and I congratulate
you,&rdquo; he said warmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve rendered a great
service to the country. I needn&rsquo;t tell you what
an enormous amount of damage and delay would
have resulted if the fire had gotten a start; you
seem to have realized that perfectly. You&rsquo;re
quite certain of your identification of the man you
saw in Washington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite, sir. I&rsquo;d be willing to swear to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have to later when the secret service
men take hold,&rdquo; said Major Whitcomb. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a fine bag,&rdquo; he added grimly, his glance sweeping
the further end of the room where several sullen-faced
men stood guarded by half a dozen soldiers
and two lay helpless on mattresses with doctors
bending over them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got all six, thanks
to you. Well, you&rsquo;ll be wanting to get back to
your friends; they&rsquo;ll be anxious about you. I&rsquo;ll
send you over in my car at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He called the sergeant and gave a crisp order.
Then, with a cordial word or two of farewell, he
dismissed the boy and Steve left the building.
Five minutes later he was leaning back in the officer&rsquo;s
car speeding toward Shelbourne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Now that there was nothing more for him to do,
the inevitable reaction had come, and he could
scarcely hold his head up. Every muscle ached;
the cut in his thigh and that other lesser one across
his face, burned and stung. With head back and
eyes half closed, he listened vaguely to the remarks
of the soldier at the wheel, but the mere
answering of the man&rsquo;s occasional question seemed
like the most tremendous effort.</p>
<p>They had reached the outskirts of the village,
and the car was just turning into the lighted main
street, when a sudden shout halted the chauffeur,
who slowed down and stopped. A moment later
the car was surrounded by a mob of excited boys
and before Steve realized what was happening,
he was dragged from his seat by a dozen hands,
while a score of voices poured question after
question into his dazed ears.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Wendell who came to his rescue
and to whom he conveyed the information that
the fire was under control and everything practically
all right. Seeing the boy&rsquo;s state of exhaustion,
the scoutmaster did not press him further,
and the whole crowd turned back to the docks,
with Haddon in the center. It was not human
nature to refrain from asking questions, and little
by little during their trip back to camp the essential
incidents of Steve&rsquo;s adventures were extracted
in scraps and disjointed sentences.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>The details followed next morning. A night&rsquo;s
rest put new life into the boy and though he hated
talking about himself, he very soon found that
he would have no peace until he had answered
every question. It was Cavanaugh, in fact, who
suggested to Mr. Wendell soon after breakfast
that Haddon might as well tell his story to the
assembled crowd and get it over with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right, Jim,&rdquo; agreed the scoutmaster.
&ldquo;We really ought to save the yarn for
the council fire to-night, but I don&rsquo;t suppose the
fellows can wait that long. As a matter of fact I
feel a sort of hankering myself to know just how
it all came about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, in the shade of the mess tent, with the
scouts gathered about him in a close circle, Steve
told his tale. He was stammering and embarrassed
at first, but gradually he warmed to the
narration, losing his self consciousness in the interest
of recalling the strenuous hours on Loon
Island and in the pursuit along the beach through
the storm. To be sure, he quite failed to do himself
justice and only persistent questioning
brought out the details he slurred over. But
Cavvy, who sat beside him, saw to it that those
questions were asked and answered, and when it
was over the two strolled off together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to think that we laughed that night you
told us about the man in the dory,&rdquo; remarked the
blond fellow whimsically after a brief silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it sounded awfully silly the way I
put it,&rdquo; said Steve quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We</i> were the silly ones&mdash;regular nuts, in
fact.&rdquo; Cavvy sighed. &ldquo;I wish to thunder I&rsquo;d
been with you, old kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve laughed a little. &ldquo;I wish you had. I
never wanted anything more in my life when I was
stumbling along that beach through the dark. I
was scared then, all right. Now, if you&rsquo;d only
been along&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have been scared together, I guess,&rdquo;
chuckled Cavvy. &ldquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s an
end to it. How does it feel to be a celebrity?
You&rsquo;ll have your name in the paper, and be
thanked by the Government, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slush!&rdquo; Steve pounded his friend on the
back and when the brief tussle subsided, he
hastened to change the subject.</p>
<p>This was not difficult, for there were plenty of
other topics to occupy them. With two weeks of
camp gone, the third and last one seemed crowded
with various contests and scout activities for
which there had not been time before. That very
afternoon an aquatic meet was scheduled, and to-morrow
would be taken up by the track events
which would go far toward deciding who was going
to win the coveted camp emblem for the year.
An all day picnic to Loon Island was also being
considered, and after that the day of departure
loomed disagreeably near.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>It came all too soon for everyone&mdash;the end of
those three golden weeks which, at the beginning,
had seemed almost as if they were going to last
all summer. Scarcely a boy in the crowd but
longed to stretch them into six, and it was no
small tribute to their new-found sense of responsibility
and willingness to serve, that not one
of them even made the suggestion.</p>
<p>They had their work to do at home&mdash;on farms,
in gardens, in the woods and along the country
roads searching out black walnut trees for the
Government. There were War Saving stamps to
sell, and all those other duties which the war had
brought home to them. It had been understood
in the beginning that three weeks was the utmost
which could be taken from those tasks, and even
around the council fire on that last evening there
were no complaints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just think of the years when we had a
whole three months&rsquo; vacation,&rdquo; sighed Cavvy
whimsically, after the last song had been sung and
they were moving slowly tentwards. &ldquo;Those
were the good old days, all right. You never appreciate
what you&rsquo;ve got&mdash;till you haven&rsquo;t got it.&rdquo;
He sighed. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you couldn&rsquo;t change your
mind, old man, and stay a couple of weeks with me
before you go home?&rdquo; he added, to Steve Haddon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; the big chap said regretfully.
&ldquo;Dad hasn&rsquo;t been away from Washington even
over a Sunday. He says he&rsquo;s nearly driven to
death and is counting on me to help him out with
clerical work. I wish I could, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t wish it any more than I do. But
if you can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t. Lord knows we&rsquo;re doing
little enough to help. Gee! but I wish I was old
enough to enlist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going into the Navy if this war lasts two
years more,&rdquo; volunteered Haddon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are? Same here. That&rsquo;s funny, isn&rsquo;t
it? I hope&mdash; Well, no I don&rsquo;t, either. Nobody
wants it to last any longer than it has to, but I
would like to get into it some way besides grubbing
with a hoe and selling Liberty Bonds. See
here; if you can&rsquo;t come now, will you promise to
visit me during Christmas vacation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll spend part of it with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bargain.&rdquo; In front of the tent their
hands met in a firm clasp. Then Cavvy groaned.
&ldquo;Reveille at four&mdash;and two hours&rsquo; hard work
striking tents!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;d better
hit the hay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;WHAT IS SCOUTING FOR?&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>A week later the camp on Long Point was
only a memory&mdash;something to discuss
pleasantly, perhaps, at odd moments, but
of little real importance compared with the ordinary
work and play of the crowd who had been
there.</p>
<p>Work decidedly predominated with most of
them. Back at Wharton, where the majority
lived, they took up their self imposed duties with
conscientious vigor, if not with complete enthusiasm.
For it must be confessed that the average
youngster hates work. There are those who believe,
or imagine they do, that there is nothing a
boy loves more than to be out in the dewy freshness
of a summer morning, turning the &ldquo;fragrant
earth,&rdquo; or leading an enthusiastic attack on the
enemy weed.</p>
<p>Let such persons inform themselves from life.
Early rising is only popular amongst the young
when an adventure is on foot. Nine-tenths of our
youthful population detest weeding, and to them
the hoe is an implement of torture strangely and
inexplicably neglected by the Inquisition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>It was to their credit, therefore, that the scouts
of Wharton devoted themselves so conscientiously
to the tasks at hand, which happened to be mainly
rural. The town itself lived principally by, and
for, the great mines. But in the surrounding
country were many and excellent farms, and the
fact that the great bulk of unenlisted men were
working in shaft and smelter made the services of
boys on the land more than usually welcome.
Even Harry Ritter did his part, though with a
good deal of surface grumbling and complaint.
And Cavvy, out on his grandfather&rsquo;s farm,
resolutely took his share of work as it came, finding
some additional comfort in the realization that
the hardening muscles and increasing girth of
chest would be of no small benefit to him on the
football field that fall.</p>
<p>Of course it wasn&rsquo;t all unadulterated slavery.
On the contrary there were a good many relaxations.
They had the weekly scout meetings to
look forward to, and Mr. Wendell worked hard to
make these especially attractive. Now and again
they took a day off to hike through the woods in
search of walnut trees. And through it all there
was undoubtedly a strong feeling of satisfaction
that, with the whole world working earnestly
toward a single great end, they were doing something
concrete to help in its attainment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>In this wise came September and the opening
of school. Most of the troop attended the Wharton
High School, or were in the eighth grade, and
saw each other every day. Cavanaugh greatly
missed Steve Haddon, who had long ago returned
to his home in Washington, but he found compensation
in the companionship of Bill McBride,
who was a near neighbor, and had many similar
tastes. Besides, between lessons, football and
duties connected with the troop, he had little time
to waste in lamenting the absence of even so good
a friend as Haddon had come to be.</p>
<p>Cavvy, as senior patrol leader, was very keenly
interested in the welfare and development of the
troop. His ambition was to make it the best and
biggest in the county, and to this end he worked
hard and constantly, and was of no little aid to
Mr. Wendell. There were times, however, when
their ideas were very much at variance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Had anyone asked Cavvy what he considered the
qualifications of a good scout, he would probably
have enumerated &ldquo;pep,&rdquo; keenness to get on, interest
in the troop and the work generally, and
the like. But back in his mind, unvoiced perhaps
even to himself, he held something of the standard
by which men are picked for college fraternities.
He preferred the members of the troop to be more
or less of good family, to be prominent in school
or athletics, to be good fellows, quick, amusing,
capable, and of his own class. Perhaps the scoutmaster
sensed something of this. He had a quiet
way of sizing up one&rsquo;s mental processes which
was sometimes rather disconcerting. At all
events at a meeting of the troop leaders, he
brought the discussion around to that very point
and ended with a little lecture on the subject.</p>
<p>The meeting was held as usual in the scout master&rsquo;s
study, a room of comfortable chairs, book-lined
walls, and interesting souvenirs and relics
of many sorts. There were swords and daggers
from the East, old flint-locks, Indian pottery, old
bronzes and a multitude of other curious things
which the boys were never tired of looking over.
In cold weather a fire always glimmered on the
broad hearth, and to-day, though this was empty,
they had from force of habit gathered around it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the things I&rsquo;ve noticed about a good
many troops,&rdquo; said Mr. Wendell, leaning back in
his chair, &ldquo;is a tendency to be just a little clannish.
It&rsquo;s perfectly natural, of course. A fellow wants
his own particular friends in the troop and in
proposing a member he naturally picks a boy he
knows, who&rsquo;s in his class, or on his team or lives
next door. That&rsquo;s human nature, but the result
is narrowing and to my mind it defeats one of the
great fundamental objects of Scouting&mdash;democracy.
Take our own troop, for instance. We&rsquo;ve
got a corking bunch of fellows who work well and
play well together. But there&rsquo;s a whole great
class in Wharton that we haven&rsquo;t even touched.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>He paused and the boys glanced doubtfully at
one another. Cavanaugh&rsquo;s forehead was crinkled
with a little frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash; You think we ought to take in
fellows from the&mdash;mine families?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Wendell smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re mostly Da&mdash;er&mdash;Italians and
Poles and all that,&rdquo; protested Cavvy.</p>
<p>The scoutmaster&rsquo;s smile deepened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavanaugh flushed faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re mostly an awful lot of roughnecks.
Besides, they don&rsquo;t know anything about scouting,
and I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;d want to belong if they
were asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wendell crossed his legs and linked his
strong, brown fingers around one knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re mistaken&mdash;just a little,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;And even if you&rsquo;re right&mdash;even if they
don&rsquo;t know or care anything about it, I think we
ought to make an effort to take scouting to them.
The majority are boys from poor families. Some
of them work in the mines all day. They haven&rsquo;t
many pleasures or relaxations except what they
find on the street corners at night. The scouting
program would be a revelation, and I feel sure
would save many of them from getting into idle,
useless, even vicious ways.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>His eyes twinkled and a smile curved the corners
of his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to think I&rsquo;m preaching. I
know perfectly well that none of you look on the
troop as a missionary work, or a means of reformation&mdash;and
it isn&rsquo;t. The normal fellow joins because
he thinks he&rsquo;s going to have a good time, or
because he&rsquo;s interested in some particular feature
of the program. That&rsquo;s as it should be; I&rsquo;ve no
kick coming there. As you get into it, you grow
more and more interested, and end by doing willingly
what before you&rsquo;d probably have thought a
beastly bore. We&rsquo;ve got through a lot of hard
work together this summer, and yet I think we&rsquo;ve
had some pretty good times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand, either, what I&rsquo;ve just
said. The troop is yours, and you have the right
of taking in or turning down any one you choose.
I&rsquo;d just like to have the doors a little wider open.
Personally I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;d find a single
drawback in taking in some of these fellows. Human
nature is the same everywhere, and a boy
from the shaft or the smelter has in him the makings
of just as good a scout as one from&mdash;High
School.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>He glanced at the clock and then stood up. &ldquo;I
guess there&rsquo;s nothing else to-day. Just think
over what I&rsquo;ve said and discuss it amongst yourselves.
Next meeting you&rsquo;ll have a chance of
voting on that young Tallerico chap who applied
two weeks ago. I suppose it was he who put this
into my head. But remember this: whatever you
do, do it because you feel you want to and it&rsquo;s
right, and not because you think I&rsquo;d like you to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">THE TALLERICO KID</span></h2>
<p>The little group of scouts filed out of the
room and left the house quietly enough,
but once in the street their tongues were
loosened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; declared Cavvy, in his
impulsive, rather positive manner. &ldquo;You know
what kind of a bunch that mine gang is. I&rsquo;ll bet
a soda you couldn&rsquo;t haul one into the troop with a
rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, it&rsquo;s just as Mr. Wendell says,&rdquo; remarked
Clay Marshall. He was tall and rather quiet, and
took his new position as leader of the Owl Patrol
very seriously. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve never had a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve never asked for one,&rdquo; returned
Cavanaugh. &ldquo;This&mdash;er&mdash;Tallerico is the first one
I ever heard of who showed the slightest desire
to belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill McBride laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know as you can blame them for
that. You know how much the fellows run in sets
in this town. I don&rsquo;t suppose even those chaps
would try and push themselves in where they think
they&rsquo;re not wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Cavvy frowned impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;They
haven&rsquo;t tried; anyway they&rsquo;re not the sort we
want. Can you imagine Red Garrity a scout?&rdquo;
he added triumphantly.</p>
<p>There was a momentary silence and into the
minds of those present there flashed a picture of
the ragged, red-haired, pugnacious young tough
in question. A leader of his kind, he smoked and
swore and lost no chance to jeer openly at the
scouts whenever they crossed his path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Ted Hinckley. &ldquo;At present
he don&rsquo;t seem very promising. But I&rsquo;ll tell
you this, old man; if he ever got the scout bug,
he&rsquo;d make a crackerjack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me sick,&rdquo; sniffed Cavvy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d
never get the scout bug, as you call it&mdash;never in
a thousand years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time they had reached the center of the
town and paused in front of the Post Office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that don&rsquo;t apply to Tallerico,&rdquo; remarked
Harry Ritter. &ldquo;He has applied and he wants to
get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I want him either,&rdquo; declared
Cavanaugh stubbornly. &ldquo;What does a wop like
that care about scouting, I&rsquo;d like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ritter pursed up his lips. He rarely lost a
chance of arguing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;None of us knew much about it when we first
joined,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;We picked it up afterwards.
He doesn&rsquo;t seem half bad to me, even if
he is a foreigner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it!&rdquo; Cavvy caught him up hotly.
&ldquo;He <i>is</i> a foreigner. What do you s&rsquo;pose he knows
or cares about the flag, or patriotism or anything
like that? Those fellows don&rsquo;t give a hang about
this country. Dad says they all come over here
just because they can make more money than at
home. As soon as they&rsquo;ve saved up enough they
hustle back to spend it over there. They&rsquo;re not
Americans and never will be, even if a few of them
do get naturalized. We don&rsquo;t want that kind in
the troop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A brief silence fell upon the boys, some of whom
looked convinced, others doubtful. Jim Cavanaugh&rsquo;s
statements, even when slightly illogical as
at present, frequently carried the crowd, for he
was the type which dominates by sheer force of
temperament. Besides, his father was superintendent
of the iron mines, and one whose opinion
carried weight. Nevertheless, Ritter refused to
relinquish his stand so readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s true of some of them, but why
shouldn&rsquo;t this fellow be an exception,&rdquo; he persisted.
&ldquo;I was talking to him last night and he
doesn&rsquo;t seem like a foreigner. He speaks English
all right, and he&rsquo;s got some good ideas about scouting.
Besides, you know what Mr. Wendell said.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Cavvy frowned impatiently. He had an uncomfortable
feeling of being somehow in the
wrong, but opposition always roused all that was
stubborn and contentious in his disposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;I was there,
wasn&rsquo;t I? You&rsquo;ll remember, perhaps, that he also
said the troop was our own and that we have the
right to take in or keep out whoever we choose.
Of course you fellows can do as you please, but
I know what I&rsquo;m talking about and how I&rsquo;m going
to vote. Come ahead, Micky; the whistle blew
five minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply, he turned away
and with Bill McBride, walked briskly down the
street. His temper was distinctly ruffled, the
more so, perhaps, from the realization that his
arguments had been far from strong. He was
also annoyed and disgruntled at Mr. Wendell for
having brought up the subject at all, and particularly
for the attitude he had taken. For a
time he walked on silently. Then he glanced at
his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fat&rsquo;s such an ass,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>McBride smiled and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does love to hear himself talk,&rdquo; he
chuckled. &ldquo;He likes it almost as well as eating.
Still, of course there is a little something in what
he said. I suppose we might broaden out some
without hurting ourselves. A roughneck like Garrity
would be the limit, but this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>He broke off with an exclamation of interest.
&ldquo;There he is now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh? What&mdash;who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Tallerico kid over there in front of the
old Jessup house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavvy frowned and glanced quickly across the
street. Their short cut home took them through
the older portion of town&mdash;a region of ancient,
tumble-down houses, once the abode of wealth and
fashion, but long since given over to laborers and
workmen in the mines.</p>
<p>Amongst these dingy, decrepit tenements the
Jessup house stood forth with a faded, forlorn
distinction. In its simple, dignified proportions,
in the graceful fanlight above the door, and in certain
delicate bits of molding and carving, there
remained traces of the colonial mansion where
General Washington had slept more than once in
the early winters of the Revolution.</p>
<p>On the threshold, one hand resting on the latch,
stood a boy of fourteen or so, short, square-built,
with dark, wavy hair and olive skin warmly
tinged with red. His lips were half parted and
his dark eyes rested eagerly on the faces of the
two across the street, whom he had apparently
just noticed. But as their glances quickly shifted,
a shadow swept across his face and jerking open
the door, he disappeared within.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Cavanaugh felt a sudden twinge of conscience,
and to elude it he burst into abrupt denunciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a darn shame about that house!&rdquo; he exclaimed
hotly. &ldquo;Think of a place where Washington
slept let go to rack and ruin that way and
turned into a tenement for dagos! Any other
town would buy it and keep it up decently.
They&rsquo;d be proud of it. Look at those windows&mdash;every
blooming one broken and patched up with
paper and stuff. It&rsquo;s disgusting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two whole ones,&rdquo; remarked McBride&mdash;&ldquo;up-stairs
to the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they amount to?&rdquo; sniffed Cavvy.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an accident they&rsquo;re not busted like the rest,
that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;ve half a mind to get after dad and
see if he can&rsquo;t wake up the mayor or somebody to
do something about it. Why, when I was down
at Mount Vernon last year&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Micky wasn&rsquo;t particularly interested in
Mount Vernon. He had heard all about that trip
once and was more intent now on getting home
to lunch than working up indignation on any subject.
He listened carelessly, occasionally punctuating
Cavvy&rsquo;s tirade with a joke, but when they
paused at his gate his mind had veered to another
subject altogether.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on down after lunch and bring your
football,&rdquo; he called, from half-way up the walk.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll round up the bunch and have a little practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; returned Cavanaugh absently.</p>
<p>Intent upon his new-born project, he presently
burst into the Cavanaugh dining room, smoothing
his rebellious crop with one hand and wiping
the back of the other&mdash;which had escaped the towel&mdash;against
his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s dad?&rdquo; he exclaimed, stopping short.
&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t gone yet, has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t get home to lunch to-day,&rdquo; explained
his mother quietly. &ldquo;He telephoned that
he&rsquo;d have to stay at the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny.&rdquo; The boy dropped into his
chair and unfolded his napkin. Almost never,
except at the time of the big cave-in three years
before, had his father failed to run home in the
car for their mid-day meal. &ldquo;There hasn&rsquo;t been
an accident, has there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s something about the men. There&rsquo;s
been some trouble amongst them for several days,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ginger!&rdquo; Cavvy straightened up. &ldquo;Maybe
it&rsquo;s those anarchists. Why don&rsquo;t they run them
out of town? All they do is to try and upset
everything and make trouble for the Government.
I bet they&rsquo;re paid by the Germans!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Mrs. Cavanaugh smiled. She was used to her
son&rsquo;s outbursts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Running them out of town isn&rsquo;t as easy as it
sounds,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Unfortunately, some of
them belong here and have their rights like any
other citizens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the mayor might do something,&rdquo; contended
Cavvy, applying himself to his lunch.
&ldquo;Does dad think there&rsquo;s going to be trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say, but I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s a little
worried. They&rsquo;re to have some kind of a mass
meeting this afternoon, and you know how easily
those foreigners are sometimes swayed. We&rsquo;ll
hope for the best, though. They&rsquo;ve always been
well treated and seemed contented, and with all
this extra work ahead I don&rsquo;t see how they can
possibly complain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her anxiety, and the desire to keep it suppressed,
caused her to forget for the moment her
intention of forbidding Jim to go near the mine
that afternoon. When the omission occurred to
her, ten minutes after lunch was over, the boy was
nowhere to be found. He had been expecting
something of the sort, and had lost no time in departing
quietly by the side door. A convenient
lane brought him quickly to the rear of the McBride
house, where a yodel summoned Micky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hustle,&rdquo; said Cavvy briefly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something
doing down at the mine and we want to be
in on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McBride nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard &rsquo;em talking it at lunch. Do you s&rsquo;pose
they&rsquo;re going to have a strike, or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know; they&rsquo;ll be fools if they do. Anyhow,
there&rsquo;s going to be a mass meeting this afternoon,
and maybe they&rsquo;ll decide then.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">QUICK WIT AND COURAGE</span></h2>
<p>Departing in haste, with ears purposely
dulled against possible parental
voices, the boys headed for the mine by
the shortest possible route. The streets were
singularly bare for a Saturday afternoon. Here
and there a woman talked anxiously to another
over a fence-rail, or there was a glimpse of children
playing in a back yard. But there were
scarcely any men to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! I hope we&rsquo;re not too late,&rdquo; commented
Cavanaugh, as they turned the last corner and
started up a steep, narrow street leading to the
open space in front of the mine property. Suddenly
he stopped. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said abruptly.</p>
<p>For a long moment they stood motionless.
Down the narrow thoroughfare swept the dull,
low, pulsating murmur of many voices rising and
falling. The windows of the houses at the end of
the street were filled with people all staring in
the same direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>They were vaguely stirred and a trifle uneasy.
What little they had heard of the disturbances of
the past week had passed mostly over their heads.
Cavvy merely knew that certain outside agitators
had been haranguing the men for the last few
days. As they panted up the slope and reached
the level they paused, startled at what lay before
them.</p>
<p>The wide, open space was packed with men.
Hundreds and hundreds in their greasy, ore-grimed
working clothes, a week&rsquo;s stubble, darkening
their already swarthy faces, stood shoulder to
shoulder in close-packed masses. That ominous
rumble of voices had ceased. Only here and there
sounded sibilant whispers or hoarse, low-voiced
comment. For the most part they were listening
intently to a speaker who stood on a box over by
the big flag pole in the center of the space.</p>
<p>Cavvy could not see the man clearly, nor could
he get the thread of what the fellow was saying.
But there was a quality of harsh, sneering dominance
in the stranger&rsquo;s voice to which he took an instant
dislike. He glanced at Micky, who had
drawn closer to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on over to those steps where we can see
something,&rdquo; he whispered, and, turning quickly,
he began to skirt the crowd.</p>
<p>McBride nodded silently. The steps in question
were already pretty well filled with late
comers, but by dint of a little squeezing the two
boys managed to gain a foothold where they could
overlook the crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>The square was a familiar spot transformed.
Every window was filled with heads. Every foot
of standing room was occupied by that close-packed
mass of men, oddly silent in contrast to
the shouting, gesticulating orator. And suddenly,
to Cavvy&rsquo;s wrought up imagination, instead of an
ordinal crowd of workmen, many of whom he
knew by sight if not by name, the throng became
a mob of strangers waiting now only the word to
launch into ravening destruction.</p>
<p>For a moment it all seemed incongruous, impossible.
Mechanically his eyes travelled up the tall,
white pole and rested dazedly on the Stars and
Stripes rippling in the hot September sun just as
it had gleamed there yesterday and the day before.
Only that seemed real. His heart swelled
unaccountably, then leaped driving the blood into
his face as a phrase from the man on the box below
stung into his consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That flag up there&mdash;what does it mean to
you?&rdquo; the fellow shouted, with an upward fling of
one long arm. &ldquo;Does it stand for <i>your</i> country,
or for a government <i>you</i> have any share in? No!
A thousand times no! It&rsquo;s like the Union Jack,
or the French Tricolor&mdash;a symbol of tyrants who
take the bread out of your mouths and fatten like
leeches on your toil.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>He paused to sweep a long lock of dark hair out
of his eyes. Then he reached out and dexterously
loosened the rope halliards. Cavvy caught his
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dirt to them, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; continued the
speaker loudly. &ldquo;They work you for their own
selfish ends and when you cry out, what do they
tell you? It&rsquo;s for the flag! Bah!&rdquo; He was
manipulating the ropes skillfully. Aghast, incredulous,
Cavvy saw the flag quiver, dip and
droop into a crumpled mass as it was dragged
swiftly downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flag&mdash;look at it!&rdquo; screamed the agitator,
deftly loosening the bunting from the halliards
and crushing it in both hands.</p>
<p>A startled murmur rose from the crowd, but
Cavvy did not hear it. He bent forward, face
white and strained, eyes glittering. Unconsciously
the fingers of one hand dug into McBride&rsquo;s
shoulder until the boy winced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at it!&rdquo; repeated the hateful voice triumphantly.
&ldquo;The symbol of tyrants! There&rsquo;s
no real flag but the emblem of universal brotherhood.
This thing&mdash;this rag, is fit for nothing but
the dirt, to be ground under foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Cavvy hoarsely. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>The words which had so infuriated him were
scarcely spoken when out of the crowd packed
around the flag-pole there leaped a boy&mdash;short,
square-built, olive skinned. Like a flash he
reached up and snatched the crumpled bunting
from the hands of the startled orator, ducked under
the arm of a burly miner who was too surprised
to stop him, and disappeared into the
throng.</p>
<p>Cavvy caught his breath and straightened.
From his point of vantage he could follow the
progress through the crowd of this new actor in
the drama. Ducking, squirming, wriggling, the
boy eluded a dozen hands stretched out to stop
him. Away from those immediately surrounding
the agitator, his progress was easier. So swift
had been his action that many of those on the outskirts
of the crowd had not even seen it. They
did not know what it was all about. Suddenly
Cavanaugh clutched McBride and dragged him
down the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting away with it. It&rsquo;s that Tallerico
kid. Come ahead, quick. Maybe he&rsquo;ll need
some help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their progress toward the point where Cavvy
thought the Italian boy would merge was more or
less hindered. The crowd was suddenly in motion,
roughly pushing in to gain a nearer view of what
was going on about the flag-pole. A bedlam of
voices chattering half a dozen tongues took the
place of that former tense silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>At last, bursting from the crowd, Cavanaugh
caught a glimpse of Tallerico darting down an
alley, and impulsively he followed. Several half-grown
mine boys were headed in the same direction,
and he determined grimly that if they meant
to stop the Italian they would not do it unhindered.</p>
<p>Down the alley he ran with Micky at his elbow.
They passed the mine boys and presently emerged
unopposed into the street beyond in time to see
Tallerico disappearing through the doorway of
the Jessup house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got away,&rdquo; said Cavvy with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>He slowed down, and McBride paused with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some kid!&rdquo; exclaimed the latter. &ldquo;Took
nerve to put across a stunt like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavanaugh did not answer. He moved slowly
on, and at the door of the old house he paused,
a curious expression on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in,&rdquo; he stated abruptly, a touch of
defiance in his glance.</p>
<p>The hall was dark and rather smelly. In the
days of Washington it had been spacious and
beautiful, but it could scarcely be called so now.
Dirt streaked the walls; odds and ends of broken
furniture cluttered the door. Four doors opened
out of the hall, all of which were closed, and Cavvy
hesitated doubtfully at the foot of the graceful,
curving, battered staircase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Then from above, punctuating the stillness,
came faintly the sound of suppressed panting.
Cavvy took the stairs at a run, McBride following
at his heels. An instant later he paused on
the threshold of a room so different from anything
he had expected that he was fairly speechless
with surprise.</p>
<p>It was long and low, with three windows, two
looking out on the street. The glass in them was
clear and unbroken; instinctively he realized that
these must be Micky&rsquo;s &ldquo;two whole windows&rdquo; of
that morning. The woodwork shone immaculate
in its creamy whiteness; the floor was clean. A
table and a few chairs were ranged against the
wall. There were other things, but just now
Cavvy had no eye for detail.</p>
<p>From the wall above the white mantel&mdash;aloof,
majestic, a touch of kindliness about the eyes, a
hint of world-weariness in the tight-lipped mouth&mdash;looked
down the face of Stuart&rsquo;s Washington.
Below the picture, startled, defiant, a little afraid,
stood the Tallerico kid, the rescued flag still
clutched tightly in his arm.</p>
<p>As recognition dawned, his tense expression
faded. His eyes softened, and with a long, relieved
sigh his lips parted in a flashing smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s <i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavvy gulped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s us,&rdquo; he answered, oblivious of grammar.
&ldquo;We thought you might need some help,
but&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off and moved swiftly toward
the boy. &ldquo;It was great&mdash;simply great!&rdquo; he exclaimed
a little incoherently. &ldquo;We got there late
and were away on the outside. When that&mdash;that
<i>beast</i> grabbed the flag, I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you,&rdquo; said Tallerico simply. &ldquo;It&mdash;it
helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavvy stared. &ldquo;Helped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded the other, smiling. &ldquo;It came
sudden, you know. I had not thought the&mdash;the
<i>faccino</i> would do the thing he did. When you
cry out it&mdash;it wake me up. I know you were too
far away to help; and so I did quickly what you
would do if you were near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slow flush crept up into Cavvy&rsquo;s face. He bit
his lip, and then one hand reached out and caught
the smaller boy by the shoulder. For an instant
he stood there silent. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fold up the flag,&rdquo; he said rather gruffly.
&ldquo;And while we&rsquo;re doing it you can tell me about
this room. It&rsquo;s got me guessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the room of the great Washington,&rdquo; explained
Tallerico promptly&mdash;&ldquo;his special room.
He was here in the Revolution. You see, my
father says General Washington is the greatest
man in the world, and when he find out about this
room he fix it up and keep it nice. Sometimes&mdash;&rdquo;
He hesitated and then went on rather shyly.
&ldquo;Sometimes, when I come here by myself and read
the history and look at his picture, it makes it all
so real as if, almost, I could turn around and&mdash;and
see him standing by the window, or&mdash;&rdquo; He
broke off with an embarrassed laugh. &ldquo;Maybe
that sounds foolish to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Cavanaugh shook his head; there was a very
curious expression on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said slowly at length, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t.
I&rsquo;ll tell you what I do think, though,&rdquo; he went on
briskly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one good scout, Tallerico.
There isn&rsquo;t a fellow in the troop who&rsquo;ll beat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark eyes glowed. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; Cavvy&rsquo;s lips parted in a
friendly grin. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a troop meeting next
Friday, and&mdash; Well, I guess he&rsquo;ll see, won&rsquo;t he,
Micky?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">THE SCOUT RALLY</span></h2>
<p>Mr. Wendell clamped some papers
carefully together and laid them within
the covers of his troop record book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;ve gone over the matter of the
Liberty Loan,&rdquo; he said, leaning back in his chair,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s one more piece of business before we
take up our final practice for the rally to-morrow.
I mean the application of young Frank Tallerico
for membership in the troop. I don&rsquo;t think I need
say much about him. He&rsquo;s been present for
several meetings and you&rsquo;ve had time to size him
up and talk over the matter amongst yourselves.
There is just one thing, though. You know I
don&rsquo;t wish to influence you in any way, but for
some time it has seemed to me we might very
well broaden out and take in more fellows like
Tallerico&mdash;boys who work or who come from
laboring families. I&rsquo;ve already talked about this
with the troop leaders, so I won&rsquo;t say any more
now. The meeting is open for nominations.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>As he ceased speaking there was a little stir
amongst the scouts seated on a long row against
the opposite wall. The scoutmaster, apt at reading
expressions, sensed a slight feeling of tension
and was prepared, as he had expected to be, for
a marked difference of opinion. Clay Marshall,
serious and full of responsibility, seemed on the
point of getting on his feet. But before he or
any one else had time to make a move, Jim Cavanaugh
sprang up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I nominate Frank Tallerico for membership,&rdquo;
he said abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second the motion,&rdquo; echoed McBride, from
his place at the head of the Eagle Patrol.</p>
<p>There was a murmur of surprise from several
quarters. Stout Harry Ritter&rsquo;s jaw gaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the fakes,&rdquo; he muttered to Ted
Hinckley beside him. &ldquo;Why, not more than a
week ago he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Wendell&rsquo;s face expressed neither his surprise
nor his gratification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve all heard the nomination,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Will you have a standing vote, or ballot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Standing vote,&rdquo; suggested several voices at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Those in favor of the nomination
please stand. Those opposed remain seated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a stir, a rustle and much scraping of feet,
the entire troop arose. The scoutmaster smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve done the
right thing, fellows. I&rsquo;ve an idea you&rsquo;ll find Tallerico
has the makings of a good scout.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has,&rdquo; said Cavanaugh emphatically.
&ldquo;May I say a word, sir? It&rsquo;s just this,&rdquo; he added
with some embarrassment, his glance traveling
swiftly over the line of scouts. &ldquo;As Fa&mdash;er&mdash;Ritter
says, not very long ago I didn&rsquo;t want him
in the troop at all. He&rsquo;s a foreigner, and I didn&rsquo;t
think he knew or cared anything about scouting
for the flag or&mdash;or anything. I was dead wrong.
You all know about what happened in front of the
Smelter buildings last Saturday. A beastly anarchist
was gassing the crowd and he pulled down
the flag and was going to tramp on it. Very
likely you&rsquo;ve heard that a boy jumped out of the
bunch and grabbed the flag and got away with it.
It broke up the meeting and afterward the men
ran the fellow and his gang out of town. Well,
that boy was Tallerico, and if he don&rsquo;t make as
fine a scout as anybody here, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just what Cavvy would have done in that event
remained unknown. A roar of applause, punctuated
by stamping feet and whistling, broke
from the troop and drowned his voice. Long
before order was restored, Cavanaugh had resumed
his seat and recovered his usual composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re going to train him yourself
for the Tenderfoot exams,&rdquo; commented Ted
Hinckley slyly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t need it,&rdquo; returned Cavvy coolly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s pretty near ready for the second class,
which is more than <i>some</i> people can say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another laugh and then Mr. Wendell
intervened. In a few words he expressed his
pleasure and appreciation of Tallerico&rsquo;s act,
which, he said, any of those present would have
been proud to have performed, and then took up
the practice for the rally.</p>
<p>This was to be a small affair confined to members
of the troop. With so much war work, and
the Liberty Loan so near, there was no time for
anything elaborate. The several patrols were
simply to compete together in various scout stunts
on the village Green, and there would also be two
or three combined maneuvers with staves and
first aid materials for the entertainment of any
onlookers who might be present.</p>
<p>Naturally there was a lot of good natured
rivalry amongst the patrols. Each leader was determined
that his particular group should come
off with the most honors, and there had been considerable
secret practicing at odd moments for
two weeks past. The meet was scheduled for
three o&rsquo;clock, and there were no late comers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>The events were started with a dressing race
in which there were six entrants, two from each
patrol. A distance was marked off and divided
into six narrow imaginary lanes, along which at
regular distances the contestants laid their shoes,
leggins, coat, belt and hat. At a given signal each
scout started down the course, putting on his
things in the order named. The one to reach the
tape first, provided he was properly dressed and
his equipment in perfect order, was the winner.</p>
<p>Naturally a good many ludicrous happenings
occurred and evoked much laughter both from the
scouts and the people lining the course. Bill McBride
came in third, and Shrimp Willett, also a
member of the Eagle Patrol, took first honors.
He was small, wiry and quick as chain lightning,
and the way he seemed to slide into his garments
as if they had been oiled, provided much entertainment
to the bystanders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That kid don&rsquo;t need much time in the morning,&rdquo;
commented one of the latter. &ldquo;Believe me,
he could get dressed on the way down stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McBride, who was standing near the line, smiled
unconsciously at the man&rsquo;s amusement. A moment
later he heard a voice behind him sneer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby&rsquo;s tricks! Gee-whiz! Ain&rsquo;t they got
nothing better to do with their time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Turning abruptly, he met the contemptuous
stare of a slouching, shabbily dressed fellow a
year or two older than himself, who lounged indolently
against a tree. A faded cap perched
rakishly on a mop of brilliant red hair; his eyes
were blue and hard and wide open. From one
corner of his mouth there dangled the butt of a
cigarette.</p>
<p>Micky flushed, and his lips parted for a swift
retort. But at that moment the signal sounded
for the next event and he had to hurry off.</p>
<p>When he passed near that portion of the Green
again the obnoxious &ldquo;Red&rdquo; Garrity was gone.
Another boy stood there, however, whom McBride
had sometimes noticed in his company. He
frowned, and then he caught an odd, almost wistful
questioning in the other&rsquo;s eyes which puzzled
him. None of that crowd of roughnecks had ever
shown the slightest interest in scout doings except
to hoot and jeer at the troop when they met in
the street. There had been more than one case of
solitary scouts or small boys in pairs who had
been roughly treated by the hoodlums under the
leadership of the red haired chap. With this in
mind, Micky was just turning away when the
other boy took a quick step forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t win that last race, did you?&rdquo;
he said hesitatingly.</p>
<p>The remark was obviously made for the sake
of creating talk. But McBride was naturally a
friendly chap, and just now he was a little curious
to know what was in the other&rsquo;s mind. So he
answered pleasantly, and quite a little conversation
ensued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hanged if he don&rsquo;t seem really interested,&rdquo;
thought the patrol leader, as he went off presently
to oversee his candidate for the firelighting contest.
&ldquo;He certainly talks that way. I don&rsquo;t
know why he shouldn&rsquo;t be, either. Those fellows
don&rsquo;t seem to have much to do except bum
around street corners, and I can&rsquo;t see any fun
in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twice afterwards he paused to chat with the
boy, whose name was Conners. Then came the
final exhibitions, and when it was all over Micky
had to hurry home to look after some chores which
must be done before supper.</p>
<p>His patrol had won out by a narrow margin,
and he was in high spirits as he took a short cut
through a rather slummy part of town. Swinging
briskly along the narrow street, he entertained
himself by recalling some of the amusing happenings
of the afternoon. Fat Ritter had been particularly
funny in the one-legged race, and Micky
was thinking how he would josh the fellow next
time they met, when he suddenly realized that
a few hundred yards ahead three figures were
lined up against a factory wall, watching him intently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>One of them was Conners; another he did not
know by name. The third was swaggering Red
Garrity. There was something unmistakably
ominous in their attitude of quiet waiting.
Things he had heard of as happening to scouts at
the hands of this red haired hooligan and his followers
flashed into Micky&rsquo;s brain, and for a second
his pace faltered and he almost stopped.</p>
<p>Then abruptly his head went up and his jaw
squared. Swiftly he resumed his stride and came
on steadily. His lips were firm, his eyes set
straight ahead; and though it must be confessed
that his heart was beating rather rapidly, he did
not show it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">ROUGHNECK GARRITY</span></h2>
<p>When Red Garrity left the Green, he
sauntered down a side street to a
small tobacco store where he bought
a package of cheap cigarettes. Outside the door
he met Shrimp McGowan and the two lounged on
a corner for half an hour or so before deciding
to indulge in a soda. This also took some time
and when it was finally over they strolled toward
the section of town that was filled with factories
and cheap dwellings in a languid search for Chick
Conners.</p>
<p>In the end it was Conners himself who did the
finding. Speeding homeward from the Green, he
overtook the two cronies dawdling along in front
of a factory. His appearance met with slightly
aggrieved inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you been all afternoon?&rdquo; demanded
Garrity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chimed in McGowan, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been looking
all over town for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conners sniffed. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have looked
very hard,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;I just come from
seeing the boy scouts on the Green.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Garrity hitched up a frayed suspender and
sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy scouts!&rdquo; he repeated in a scornful tone.
&ldquo;You must be terrible hard up, Chick, to go hanging
around that bunch of dubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conners flushed a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, I wasn&rsquo;t hanging around &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he protested.
&ldquo;I was just watching &rsquo;em do them
stunts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stunts! Do you call them loony kid games
stunts? Taking off their clothes and then seeing
which can put &rsquo;em on quickest! I ain&rsquo;t very shy
of time, but would you catch me wasting it on that
rot? Nix!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conners&rsquo; thin lips expanded in a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wasn&rsquo;t watching &rsquo;em yourself how&rsquo;d
you get wise to what they was doing?&rdquo; he countered.</p>
<p>Garrity took a long pull at the butt of a cigarette
and flicked it into the street. Then he turned on
Conners, chin thrust out aggressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need no lifetime, like some guys, to
catch on to what&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;A
glance while I was passing along the Green was
plenty. Besides, I seen enough of &rsquo;em long before
I come to this slow burg&mdash;parading around
in their cute little uniforms an&rsquo; peddling stamps
an&rsquo; the like. New York&rsquo;s full of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>He pronounced it New Yoick. And as he swaggered
there with legs wide apart, hands thrust
deep into trousers&rsquo; pockets, shabby cap cocked on
one side of an untidy mass of carroty hair, it was
not hard to guess where he hailed from. Chick
Conners eyed him with the admiring gaze of a
satellite, beneath which was a touch of doubt and
a little hint of protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s right when they&rsquo;re all dolled
up with their coats on an&rsquo; everything,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But they ain&rsquo;t always like that. A guy was telling
me they had darn good fun at their meetings,
and in summer they go off to camp, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen at him, Shrimp!&rdquo; cut in Garrity with a
loud laugh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t he talk up nice. You might
think he was hankering to be a boy scout himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conners flushed scarlet, hesitated, and then his
shoulders squared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, s&rsquo;posing I was,&rdquo; he retorted with a sort
of uneasy defiance. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what difference
it makes to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrity bent suddenly toward him, chin thrust
out, eyes angry and threatening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t, eh?&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;Well, let me
tell you something, Conners. You go fooling
around them boy scouts, and you&rsquo;re all off with
me. I don&rsquo;t pal around with that kind of a softy.
You&rsquo;d look good in one of them play soldier suits,
you would. Here comes one of &rsquo;em now. Ain&rsquo;t he
cute? Don&rsquo;t forget to s&rsquo;lute your brother scout,
Chick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>With mouth still sneering, he stepped back beside
McGowan who lounged against the wall.
After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Conners ranged himself
with the others, and with varying degrees of
expression they watched the approach of the boy
in khaki who had just swung the corner half a
block away.</p>
<p>He was about fifteen, younger and slighter than
Red Garrity, but with a trim, erect carriage which
was in marked contrast with the other&rsquo;s slouch.
On his left sleeve was a first class patrol leader&rsquo;s
badge. His clothes were neat and well brushed
and his whole equipment immaculate.</p>
<p>He walked briskly with an easy, springy stride,
the corners of his lips curving in a reminiscent
smile. Suddenly he saw them. The smile
vanished; a look of surprise and uncertainty came
into his face; he almost stopped. Then he came
on again, but with lips pressed tightly together
and much of the spring gone from his movements.</p>
<p>Garrity watched his approach, a certain pleased
expectancy in his hard blue eyes. Deliberately
he kept silent until the scout was opposite him
and beginning to think, perhaps, that he might
pass without interruption. Then one hand shot
out and gripped McBride&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;What your hurry, Cutey?&rdquo; drawled Garrity.
&ldquo;Afraid Poppa Scoutmaster will mark you late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky tried to jerk away, but the muscular fingers
dug into his arm with painful force. A deep
flush flamed into his face and his eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go,&rdquo; he demanded curtly.</p>
<p>Garrity grinned irritatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he got pretty pink cheeks?&rdquo; he drawled
insultingly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re smooth an&rsquo; soft just like a
girl&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sudden motion he brought up his free
hand, callous and none too clean, with blackened,
broken nails, and rubbed it roughly over one side
of McBride&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Shrimp McGowan tittered. Conners&rsquo; eyes
widened with a look of silent protest. A second
later there was a loud smack as Micky&rsquo;s open
palm struck Garrity&rsquo;s cheek with a force that left
a momentary imprint of his fingers on the tanned
and freckled skin. The next instant the scout was
sprawling in the gutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fresh Ike!&rdquo; snarled Garrity furiously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tan the hide off you for that. Get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dizzily McBride tried to scramble to his feet.
He had struck the curb with considerable force
and his head whirled. But he had not the least
intention of giving in to the bully without a fight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>He had scarcely risen to his knees when Garrity
knocked him down again. Micky rolled over a
couple of times and managed to gain his feet
without interference. He was conscious that
Conners had caught the red-haired fellow by an
elbow and was protesting in a shrill, uneven voice,
while McGowan stared uneasily up and down the
street. But all he actually saw was the sneering
face of his opponent as he staggered forward,
clenched fists raised in a position he thought was
scientific.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a whirlwind forward rush
which easily broke through the boy&rsquo;s unsteady
guard. Garrity had no science. His was merely
the superiority of bull strength and a total disregard
for the principles of fair fighting. McBride,
still shaky from that knock against the
curb, managed to partly parry a blow at his chest.
Then came a smothering clinch and a blow on the
face which turned the boy limp and sent him to the
ground again.</p>
<p>Garrity stepped back, his breath coming a little
unevenly. For a moment he stood motionless,
eyes fixed on the limp figure at his feet. McBride&rsquo;s
hat was gone, his coat was torn and muddied.
There was a smear of grime across one
cheek and a cut from which the blood oozed
slowly. As Red stared at the white face and the
sprawling body, so much slimmer and smaller
than his own, a curious, unwonted sense of shame
swept over him. An instant later the scout&rsquo;s eyes
opened and he looked dazedly at the fellow standing
over him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you coward!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You
beastly coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrity gave a loud, raucous laugh which somehow
held no note of mirth in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk&rsquo;s cheap,&rdquo; he sneered, hitching up his
suspender. &ldquo;I guess you won&rsquo;t get fresh again
with <i>me</i>.&rdquo; He turned and swaggered off.
&ldquo;Come ahead, fellows,&rdquo; he said over one shoulder.
&ldquo;This poor prune&rsquo;s finished. Let&rsquo;s be getting
down town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McGowan slouched along beside him. Chick
Conners took a step or two after them and then
stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t coming,&rdquo; he stated briefly.</p>
<p>Garrity turned his head and for a moment
stared steadily into the other fellow&rsquo;s face. What
he saw there brought a faint flush into his
freckled cheeks and set his forehead in a scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t?&rdquo; he repeated harshly. &ldquo;All right.
Only don&rsquo;t you come belly-aching around me to-morrow
or any other time. I&rsquo;m through with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Without waiting for a reply, he went on his way
with Shrimp, his lips pursed in a strident whistle.
At the corner, however, he glanced back for an
instant. McBride was on his feet and Conners
stood beside him. Indeed, one ragged sleeve encircled
the khaki shoulders supportingly and their
heads were close together.</p>
<p>Garrity&rsquo;s lips curled in a sneer, but the flush in
his face deepened, and in his heart there was a
queer, dull, comprehensive pang such as he had
never known before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">LEARNING TO BOX</span></h2>
<p>About a week later Bill McBride appeared
at Mr. Wendell&rsquo;s study with two
pair of nearly new boxing gloves dangling
from his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to learn how to box,&rdquo; he said directly
to the scoutmaster. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of trying to dope
it out of a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a rather bad bruise on one side of
his face which Mr. Wendell observed without appearing
to notice it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you all I know with pleasure, Bill,&rdquo;
he answered, smiling. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid that
won&rsquo;t be much more than the elements of the
science. I haven&rsquo;t had the gloves on for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McBride&rsquo;s eyes narrowed and his lips straightened
in a firm line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know more than elements, sir,&rdquo; he
stated. &ldquo;I want to really know how to box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment or two the scoutmaster stood
thoughtfully silent. Then his eyes brightened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
why I didn&rsquo;t think of it at once. I&rsquo;ve a friend
who&rsquo;s a crackerjack with the gloves,&rdquo; he went on
to McBride. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Chambers down at the bank;
you probably know him. I&rsquo;ll see if he won&rsquo;t give
you some lessons. I&rsquo;ve an idea there are several
other fellows who&rsquo;d like to take it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were. As a matter of fact more than
half the troop were eager to take up the new sport
and for a time things were rather congested.
Frank Chambers willingly lent his aid, agreeing
to give at least one night a week to the instruction.</p>
<p>There was a large barn back of Mr. Wendell&rsquo;s
house and here the two men met their pupils every
Tuesday night. The scoutmaster undertook to
coach the smaller boys and those who failed to
show especial proficiency or interest in the art.
As soon as they developed any noticeable degree
of skill, they were passed on to the more advanced
teacher.</p>
<p>Bill McBride remained only a short time in the
former class. There was no question of his keen
interest and willingness to work. He never
missed a chance to profit by instruction or to get
practice. He even bought a punching bag which
he put up at home and used whenever he had a
few spare minutes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>He came in for considerable mild joshing from
the others. They took to calling him Slugger McBride,
and wanted to know how soon he was going
to challenge the champion tissue-paper weight of
Wharton. Micky took it all serenely, or made
some apt retort, and before long his critics were
silenced by his rapidly growing expertness at the
art. Naturally quick and clever, and a good
athlete, he soon developed a skill which surprised
even his teachers. Almost from the first he could
outbox every fellow in the class save Jim Cavanaugh,
and even he was sometimes hard put to
hold his own.</p>
<p>Cavvy, by the way, was the only person who
had his confidence and knew what he was working
for. He had been furious when Micky told about
that encounter with Red Garrity, and at first was
all for getting after the fellow and giving him a
lesson. But in the end he had to abandon the
idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to it, old man,&rdquo; declared McBride
firmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my scrap, you know, and I don&rsquo;t
want anyone else butting in. I&rsquo;m going to wait
till I can handle myself half way decently and
then I&rsquo;ll show that big piece of cheese where he
gets off. It&rsquo;ll be done fair and square, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>So Cavvy had to give up his plan of interfering,
but his dislike for Garrity and his crowd was
by no means lessened. In fact when Chick Conners
appeared shyly at the troop meeting one night
and it was rumored that he wanted to join the
troop, the two friends came close to a violent disagreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of an institution will this troop
be anyhow, if we take in that sort of riffraff?&rdquo; the
older chap demanded hotly on their way home.
&ldquo;I was wrong about Tallerico, I admit. He&rsquo;s a
good kid. But Conners and Garrity and that
slimy McGowan and a lot more of &rsquo;em are all rotten.
They&rsquo;re not worth powder to blow &rsquo;em to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Jim,&rdquo; cut in Micky hastily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
dead wrong. Conners isn&rsquo;t that sort, anyhow. I
told you how decent he was that&mdash;that day. He&rsquo;s
cut away from Garrity and the rest and he wants
to be a scout. And when a fellow feels like that
I believe in giving him a chance. At the worst
we can always drop him from the troop&mdash;though
I&rsquo;m perfectly sure we won&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavvy grumbled and protested, but in the end
he gave in. The result was that at the next meeting
Chick Conners was elected, and passed his
Tenderfoot test, on which McBride had been
coaching him, the same night. He passed it well,
too, and even Cavanaugh, who still viewed him
with suspicion, could find no fault with his demeanor,
or the promptness and thoroughness of
his answers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The following Tuesday evening the attendance
at the boxing class was small. Like a good many
other experiments the general interest had
lessened considerably as the novelty began to
wear off. Some of the scouts found they did not
care as much for it as they supposed they would.
Others were not able to take the time from lessons,
especially as preparatory details for the Liberty
Loan Campaign was giving them a lot of
extra work. But there were still six or eight
eager enthusiasts who kept at it, chief amongst
them Cavanaugh and McBride, who had come to
be extraordinarily well matched. Cavvy had the
longer reach and slightly stronger punch. But
Micky could hit hard, too, was amazingly quick on
his feet, and his brain seemed to work like greased
lightning. That evening for the first time he held
Cavvy in a bout of over fifteen minutes, which
in the end was called a draw.</p>
<p>More than once Mr. Wendell found himself
watching the boy with curious, speculative interest.
It was McBride&rsquo;s way to take up things
he liked with enthusiasm and persistence. But in
this matter the scoutmaster seemed to see a degree
more of dogged purpose than usual. He felt,
somehow, that the boy was working for some definite
end, but he asked no questions. Just as the
boys were leaving, however, he spoke to Micky at
the barn door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly gave Jim a run for his money
to-night,&rdquo; he remarked smiling. &ldquo;You ought to
be able to take care of yourself mighty soon with
almost anybody at all near your weight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still faintly flushed with exercise the boy
glanced up from the gloves he was tying together.
The lantern light shone on a face glowing with
justifiable pleasure at his success. Then suddenly
the eyes narrowed slightly and his lips straightened
in an odd, determined line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been working for, sir,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">THE BOY WHO COULDN&rsquo;T SWIM</span></h2>
<p>Red Garrity slouched through the wide
gates of the Wharton Smelter Company
and glanced indolently up and down the
street. His application for a job had just been
turned down by the superintendent, but that did
not trouble him over much. He was used to it.
In fact anything else would have surprised him
after the caustic comment which had followed his
last self determined vacation. He was a good
worker&mdash;when he worked. But his habit of taking
days off whenever he felt in the mood did not
commend him to many employers of labor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bum outfit to work for, anyhow,&rdquo; he yawned,
feeling in his pocket for a cigarette.</p>
<p>He neither found one nor the means of purchasing
a fresh supply, and for the first time he looked
annoyed. He would certainly have to land a job
to-morrow and get some kale, he thought, as he
strolled up the street toward Shrimp McGowan&rsquo;s
abode. He decided to try a certain wood working
concern where he was little known, and dismissed
the subject from his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Shrimp was at home and responded to his yodel.
As he slouched down the steps, yawning and
blinking in the bright sunlight, a look of contempt
came into Garrity&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watcher been doing?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Sleeping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>McGowan gaped again and nodded. &ldquo;Nothing
else to do,&rdquo; he drawled.</p>
<p>Garrity sniffed scornfully and stifled a longing
for Chick Conners, to whom he had not spoken
for weeks. Whatever failings the latter youth
might have, at least he had always been up and
doing and ready for excursions of any sort Red
might suggest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s something doing now,&rdquo; the latter
remarked briefly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going out on the river
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shrimp showed no signs of delight at the prospect,
but after a weak protest he yielded&mdash;as he
always did. He could not understand Red&rsquo;s partiality
for these country walks. It never occurred
to him that the woods and fields and river could
hold a subtle charm for this domineering boy who
constantly belittled them in words and talked
boastingly and regretfully of the lights and bustle
and crowded excitements of the city. Indeed,
Garrity had never really admitted as much even
to himself, and in the old days he and Chick had
always been at odds regarding the relative merits
of town and country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>The road they took followed the windings of
the Monhegan River. Overhead the sky was
cloudless. The air was warm and mellow, yet
with a tonic freshness in it which stirred the blood.
The trees were beginning to turn, and their reds
and yellows contrasted strongly with the dark
bulk of pine and hemlock. Across the distant hills
lay a faint, mellow Autumn haze.</p>
<p>It was a day to thrill any boy, and Garrity was
perfectly conscious of its charm. As usual, however,
he growled and grumbled at the dullness of
the country, and talked longingly of his beloved
Bowery, but somehow Shrimp&rsquo;s slavish agreement
failed to give him pleasure.</p>
<p>They threw stones at birds and squirrels, tossed
rocks into the river and slashed at trees and
bushes with destructive knives. They strolled
erratically, visiting several orchards on the way,
and finally reached the point where the stream,
narrowing between rocky banks, flowed deep and
swift toward a picturesque waterfall which made
a favorite spot for picnicers and campers.
Here they sat down in the shade of the hemlocks
to eat their spoils.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Funny you never came out with the bunch to
swim,&rdquo; remarked McGowan after an interval of
silent munching. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;re a wonder at
it,&rdquo; he added with a touch of spiteful sarcasm that
was characteristic.</p>
<p>For a second the ever-ready Garrity hesitated,
his eyes fixed on the rushing water six feet below
the steep bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t any wonder, but I&rsquo;m good enough,&rdquo; he
boasted. &ldquo;After swimming in the East River
there ain&rsquo;t any particular fun splashing around
in this dump. Where do you go in? Right
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, no! It&rsquo;s too darn swift and rocky.
There&rsquo;s a nice pool below the falls, about a mile
down. Anybody&rsquo;d be a nut to try to here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Garrity. &ldquo;I guess I could
take care of myself all right. Say! Looka that
squirrel over there. Want to see me bean him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang up and reached hastily for a loose
stone lying on the very edge of the steep bank.
For most of the way this was solid rock, but just
here there happened to be a treacherous patch of
moss-grown earth. Red&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the
inquisitive little animal perched on the opposite
bank, and he stepped rather closer to the edge
than he intended. The next instant he felt a sickening
give beneath his feet and made a wild,
panicky effort to regain his balance. It failed.
Clawing desperately at the smooth surface of the
bank, he felt himself plunging down the deep incline,
heard a smothered cry from Shrimp, and
struck the water with a tremendous splash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>It seemed icy cold, and Red was smitten instantly
by a keen despairing horror. In spite of
his recent boasting, he had never ventured into the
East River, or any other. All he knew of swimming
was a few primitive strokes learned in one
visit to a Y. M. C. A. pool which had never been repeated.
Even those were forgotten during that
smothering, choking immersion. When he finally
came to the surface he struck out wildly, beating
the water blindly and ineffectually with his hands.
Already he had swept far past the spot where he
had fallen in. Shrimp was nowhere to be seen.
There was no one in sight&mdash;nothing save the cruel
rocky banks and the blurred shadows of the hemlocks
past which he was tossed helplessly.</p>
<p>In those awful moments which seemed like
hours, a swift procession of vivid, fantastic pictures
whirled through Red&rsquo;s despairing brain.
Then his head went under again and a moment
later, dazed and half senseless, he felt himself
driven against something hard and solid at which
he clutched with all the strength and energy of
desperation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>It was a boulder jutting up in midstream. For
a moment Red&rsquo;s progress was stayed, but he knew
that it was only the briefest respite. The swirling
current tugged at his legs and body; his
numbed fingers slipped and slid across the smooth,
waterworn surface. He thought of the fall below
with its torrent of water thundering down to that
bed of sharp pointed, fantastic rocks, and a gurgling,
choking cry of horror and despair burst
from his blue lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">A SCORE IS PAID</span></h2>
<p>Garrity&rsquo;s cry for help was purely instinctive.
He had no hope at all that it
would be answered, and his surprise was
very great when the bushes on the bank above
him were thrust aside and a slim figure appeared,
to stare down in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; he cried again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m drowning!
Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a swift scurry on the bank&mdash;the opposite
bank from the one from whence Red had
come. A coat flew off; shoes were tossed aside.
Garrity&rsquo;s heart sank as he realized that it was
only a boy smaller than himself, but in spite of
everything he could not help admiring the clean,
graceful, unhesitating dive with which the fellow
took the water. Then suddenly he lost his hold on
the rock and the current caught him again.</p>
<p>A moment later a dripping head rose beside
him. Red caught at it wildly, but a foot struck
him in the stomach and drove him sickeningly
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; the voice beat on his dazed brain.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me and I&rsquo;ll get you out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>The head vanished, but something slid across
his neck and he felt a tug at his straggling hair.
The impulse was irresistible to try and grab the
arm which held him up, and he started to squirm
around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut that out!&rdquo; ordered the voice sharply.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was grit in Garrity&rsquo;s make-up, and fortunately
he was not quite too far gone to reason.
He had little faith in the boy&rsquo;s ability to save
him, but at least his face was partly out of the
water and he could breathe. His teeth dug into
his under lip until it bled. Cold fear was tugging
at his heart, but he made the effort, and let his
muscles lax.</p>
<p>For a space nothing happened save that he did
not sink under the water again. Then all at once
he saw the bank closer than it had been before.
It was lower, too, and shelving. A wild hope
sprang up, followed swiftly by wilder panic. For
though they still moved, it was more slowly, and
gasping sounds of distress came from his rescuer.</p>
<p>Strainingly Red&rsquo;s eyes watched the bank.
Would they ever gain it? It was scarcely two
feet above his head and little more than that away.
Suddenly he felt a little push. An instant later
his clawing fingers caught at a thrusting root, his
feet struck bottom, and with a strangled sob he
half pulled himself, half crawled onto a slippery
shelf of rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>For a moment or two he lay motionless, drawing
in the air in great gulps. He felt chilled to the
bone and every muscle ached, but nothing really
mattered now. Finally he struggled up and
turned his head. A white-faced, panting boy in
dripping khaki lay beside him, a strange expression
in his great gray eyes. Garrity&rsquo;s own grew
wider, his jaw dropped. Somehow he felt choked
and speechless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he gasped at length in a strangled
voice. &ldquo;<i>You!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill McBride merely nodded. He was too busy
getting his breath to speak. At length he sat up
and presently got on his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
<p>Garrity followed him without question. His
mind was a turmoil of dazed thoughts. In silence
they climbed the bank and pushed through the
undergrowth. Presently they reached a little
clearing amongst the pines. A scout axe, a hat
and an open haversack lay there, and close to them
a neat pile of twigs and small sticks.</p>
<p>McBride knelt down and with fingers that shook
a little drew a box of matches from the haversack.
With one of these he lit the pile of sticks and when
the fire was well going, he stood up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take off your clothes and dry &rsquo;em out,&rdquo; he
told Garrity briefly.</p>
<p>As one in a dream, Red obeyed. When he had
wrung out his soaking garments, he followed the
scout&rsquo;s example and made a little frame of sticks
to hang them on before the fire. And all the time
he was doing this he watched his companion with
furtive, curious glances. He did not seem at all
like the boy he had knocked about on the street
that day. There was an air of quiet competence
about his every movement which roused in Red&rsquo;s
heart an odd, unexpected admiration. Though he
would never have admitted it, he knew he
couldn&rsquo;t have made that fire so quickly and
so skillfully. Even his frame of sticks was
crude and wobbly compared with McBride&rsquo;s.
And as for the horrible experience in the
water&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Micky suddenly, straightening
his slim, white body. &ldquo;Are you through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrity nodded and thrust one upright stick
more firmly into the pine needles. It was cool
here in the shade and he shivered slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said McBride. &ldquo;Come out here in
the open, then. I&rsquo;m going to give you a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrity&rsquo;s jaw gaped. &ldquo;A&mdash;what?&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;Whatcher mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to fight. Is that plain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red&rsquo;s wide eyes mirrored his amazement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, say!&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to
fight&mdash;<i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you, though?&rdquo; McBride&rsquo;s lips tightened.
&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t so particular a few weeks
ago. You didn&rsquo;t mind hitting me foul and then
knocking me around before I could get up. You
big stiff!&rdquo; His tone brought the blood tingling
into Garrity&rsquo;s freckled face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
you ever fought fair in all your life. Do you
want me to slap your face again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a quick step forward, his eyes blazing.
Garrity, dazed, yet furiously angry, flung up one
hand&mdash;and the fight was on.</p>
<p>As usual, Red lunged forward to get into a
clinch. To his amazement he got an upper cut
which drove him backward half a dozen feet
where he scraped painfully against a pine trunk.
Wild with pain and rage, he plunged at his opponent
again, to find that this was an altogether
different McBride from the one he thought he
knew.</p>
<p>Quick on his feet, cool, competent, the scout
seemed to slide out of the bear-like embrace with
ease, landing a smart blow on Red&rsquo;s chest as he
did so. With a savage growl Garrity pulled up
and whirled around. This time he would surely
get him. He came forward more cautiously,
muscular arms outspread. The next thing he
knew he struck the ground with a jarring force
which was only partly tempered by the thick bed
of pine needles. Dazed a little, but undeterred,
he scrambled up and leaped forward again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>But somehow Red&rsquo;s moment never came.
Ducking, dodging, feinting, countering, the
smaller fellow simply played with his clumsy opponent.
Not for a moment did he let him rest.
Now and then he got in a smashing blow with all
the force of his weight and muscle behind it,
which brought a gasp from Garrity&rsquo;s wide lips.
Constantly he lured the other on to frantic rushes
which took the fellow&rsquo;s strength and got his wind,
while McBride, with the skill he had gained in
these past weeks of work, expended not even an
unnecessary ounce of effort.</p>
<p>At last there came the moment Micky had hoped
for. Sweat streaming down his face and chest,
breath coming in loud gasps, Garrity staggered
back from where he had been flung amongst some
bushes. As he came slowly, he swayed a little,
and McBride, watching his face narrowly, stiffened.
A little feinting, and then a blow on the
jaw with all his strength back of it, would settle
things&mdash;would pay for that humiliating experience
the thought of which had rankled in his
memory all these weeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>He took a quick step forward and then he
paused. Something in that strained, white,
dogged face before him brought to the scout a sudden
strange sense of repugnance in his task. The
fellow was game, all right. He would not turn
tail as long as he could keep his feet and senses.
But that dazed look of bewildered pain in his eyes
told its own story of a suffering which was more
than physical. Micky was conscious of a sudden
sense of shame at the purpose in his mind; his
arms fell abruptly to his sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had enough?&rdquo; he asked gruffly.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Garrity&rsquo;s head drooped
wearily. &ldquo;Y&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>In silence they went back to the fire and began
to put on their dried clothing. Not a word was
spoken until they were nearly dressed. Then it
was Garrity who broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t say nothing&mdash;about your&mdash;pulling
me out,&rdquo; he muttered, eyes fixed on a refractory
shoelace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned McBride briefly,
reaching for the haversack which held the grub
he had brought on this solitary hike. &ldquo;Any scout
would have done the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red&rsquo;s glance shifted from the fire to the empty
rack of sticks and then back to McBride&rsquo;s mussed
and wrinkled shirt and breeches. A poignant
memory of those horrible moments in the river
made him shiver. He picked up a narrow strip
of bark and began to twist it about his fingers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I want to tell you&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry for&mdash;for what
I&rsquo;ve said about the&mdash;scouts,&rdquo; he said presently
in a low, embarrassed voice. His head was lowered
and his face flushed. &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t understand,
I guess. They&rsquo;re not&mdash;like what I thought
they was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you did,&rdquo; cut in Micky suddenly.
&ldquo;Why should you?&rdquo; He had accomplished
what he had set out to do, and with the
responsibility of it gone, he was more like his old
easy going, friendly self than he had been for
weeks. And as he looked at Garrity&rsquo;s downcast,
embarrassed face he realized all at once that the
fellow wasn&rsquo;t wholly bad. In fact at the moment
he found something almost appealing about him.
&ldquo;Nobody ever does really understand scouts unless
they travel around with them or see a troop
working,&rdquo; he went on impulsively. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
better come down some Friday night and look us
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrity&rsquo;s head went up and he stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>McBride smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Your old friend Conners is in the
troop now. He&rsquo;s going to join the boxing class
next week. Why don&rsquo;t you come down and see
how he makes out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red&rsquo;s eyes drooped again. He felt a curious
warmth stealing over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe&mdash;I might,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">THE HAUNTED CABIN</span></h2>
<p>It was the end of a glorious fall day early in
November. Autumn had held back this year
and the hills around Wharton were flaming
with masses of red and yellow, which stood out
against the darker pine and hemlock in raw
splashes of gorgeous color. The air was balmy,
yet with a touch of crispness which made tramping
exhilarating, and also roused pleasant thoughts
of cracking fires and the snug warmth of indoor
cheer which make the most delightful possible
endings for such a tramp.</p>
<p>Eight scouts from the Wharton troop were
off for an overnight hike. There had been few
enough of these this Fall, owing to the work on
the Liberty Loan, campaigns for War Saving
Stamps and the like. But now there was a
momentary breathing spell and Cavanaugh, McBride
and six others from the troop had been
prompt to take advantage of it. Amongst the
others were Chick Conners and&mdash;Red Garrity!
The latter had been a member of the troop for
just one week but already he was clothed in a
complete scout uniform which made a different
fellow of him. It was plain that he tried to appear
unconscious of his attire, but at times he
seemed unable to resist a swift downward glance
of admiring approval at the smooth folds of spotless
khaki.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Full of high spirits, they tramped along the
steep, crooked wood road, laughing, joking, playing
tricks on each other, and apparently quite
oblivious of the weight of haversack and blanket
roll with which each one was burdened. But as
they drew near their journey&rsquo;s end, they sobered
down a trifle and began to discuss the cabin with
interest and curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t haunted&mdash;really,&rdquo; said
Fernald Barber at length, in a pause which
followed some especially lurid story.</p>
<p>He had meant the remark to be a positive statement,
but somehow a touch of questioning crept
into his voice. He was an imaginative boy, and
the story had impressed him strongly. Moreover,
dusk was approaching, and the trees cast long
shadows across the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, you nut,&rdquo; laughed Cavanaugh,
glancing back. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such things as
haunts, is there, Micky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>McBride shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I guess not,
Cavvy,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;I never saw one, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor anybody else,&rdquo; affirmed the patrol leader
positively. &ldquo;Just because old Morford lived
alone in the cabin for so long, and was found
dead back in the woods, a lot of loafers down
town have made up a lovely yarn about his ghost
coming back and hanging around the place. It&rsquo;s
all the worst kind of rot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why it ain&rsquo;t ever been lived in
since?&rdquo; remarked Chick Conners curiously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
been empty a couple of years, you said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but who&rsquo;d want it? It&rsquo;s miles away
from everything, and unless you found another
old hermit like Morford, who spent most of his
time rambling around the hills, I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;d
have any use for it. Dad stopped there a couple
of times while he was out hunting, and I was there
once myself last fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you stay over night?&rdquo; asked Barber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;d just as soon have. There&rsquo;s not
a thing the matter of it except a little damp.
The roof&rsquo;s tight and there&rsquo;s some wooden bunks,
and a dandy stone fireplace. I don&rsquo;t know what
happened to the furniture. I guess it was the
homemade kind and was broken up for firewood.
With some tables and chairs and cooking utensils
and things, it would make a dandy place for the
troop to come on overnight hikes. I only wish I&rsquo;d
thought of it before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to make the most of it now,&rdquo;
said McBride. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s speed up, Cavvy. It&rsquo;ll
be dark pretty quick, and we&rsquo;ve got to rustle
around for wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of time,&rdquo; returned Cavanaugh.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be there in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless he quickened his pace and for a
while conversation ceased as the others followed
him closely up the narrow, winding trail. One
or two, like Barber, may have been slightly
affected by the weird tales they had heard of the
shack and its former eccentric owner, but the
majority were simply curious for a glimpse of the
place and eager to reach their destination and
settle down restfully after their long tramp.</p>
<p>The trail, which was scarcely more than a track,
followed the rocky edge of a deep ravine. There
was a glint of water down below, but in those
depths already shadows were creeping up, filling
the hollows, smoothing over the rough slopes, obliterating
one by one each separate detail of tree
and rock and brawling stream. On the other
side the slope swept steeply upward, covered with
close-set ranks of pines, whose long branches
spread out over the trail itself.</p>
<p>Presently the road curved sharply to the right
around a mass of fern-covered rock, twisted erratically
for a space amongst the trunks of tall,
straight pines, turned again, and ended abruptly
on an open shoulder of the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is,&rdquo; announced Cavvy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Before them, at the top of a gentle slope a long,
low, structure of logs nestled against a background
of trees. Close to one side towered a giant
pine, its feathery branches overhanging the sloping
roof of slabs. The closed door was almost
hidden in the shadow of a wide, projecting roof,
and to Furn Barber the whole place fairly
breathed desertion and loneliness. But he would
have perished rather than reveal that feeling to
the others, and he was one of the first to dash up
the slope and cluster around the door.</p>
<p>This was merely on the latch, and in a moment
they had swarmed inside and were staring about
in eager curiosity. Opposite them yawned a great
stone fireplace, cavernous and empty. On the left
was a shuttered window and on the other side
stood a double tier of wooden bunks. There were
some rough shelves at one side of the chimney,
and a couple of empty boxes on the floor, but that
was all.</p>
<p>For a moment no one spoke. The silence, the
bare emptiness, the shadows in the corners, undoubtedly
gave the place a gloomy look, and
there was a damp chill over it all which was not
exactly pleasant. McBride was the first to
speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a dandy place, Cavvy,&rdquo; he said
cheerily. Micky was one who always made the
best of everything, and there were moreover, possibilities
about the cabin which he sensed before
the others. &ldquo;All we need is a fire and some lights
to make it as homelike as can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words broke the spell. Candles were
quickly produced and lighted, and then the whole
crowd hustled out for wood. There was plenty
about in the shape of dead limbs and fallen trees,
and each scout worked with a will cutting it up
and dragging it in. In an hour a roaring fire
blazed on the hearth and there was a pile outside
the cabin door which would easily carry them
through the night.</p>
<p>The transformation was surprising. The firelight
flickered cheerily on the log walls, driving
out the shadows and brightening every corner.
Blankets spread out in the bunks, and a litter of
cooking utensils around the hearth, took off much
of the bare appearance. And when cooking operations
began the place resounded with the clatter
of dishes, with jokes, laughter and noisy but good
natured disputes, until it would have taken a
powerful imagination indeed to detect anything
&ldquo;spooky&rdquo; about it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Furn Barber&rsquo;s mind was not entirely
at ease. To be sure, he thoroughly enjoyed
cooking and eating supper, and the fun which
went on then and afterwards. But when bedtime
came and the bustle of turning in was over, his
thoughts returned to the weird tales he had heard
of old Morford&rsquo;s &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; and lingered there with
growing apprehension.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>He occupied one of the bunks with McBride,
and long after everyone else had gone to sleep,
he lay watching the flames leaping in the fireplace,
and their reflection glowing and dancing on the
walls and roof. Every now and again, as the
fire died a little, his glance swept shadowy corners
nervously and he shivered at some particularly
creepy detail of the stories he had been told about
the place.</p>
<p>But even his wrought up imagination could find
nothing very fearful in this peaceful picture, and
at length he dozed off.</p>
<p>He woke with a start to find the room in darkness.
The fire had died down to a dull red glow
which illuminated only a foot or two of the stone
hearth. Everything else was swathed in shadows&mdash;everything,
that is, save&mdash;</p>
<p>Barber gasped suddenly and sat up tingling,
his gaze fixed fearfully on the farther wall of the
cabin. For a long moment he stared, wide-eyed,
horrified, at the motionless, shapeless figure
which stood out, vaguely white against the glass
of the window. Then suddenly it moved with a
slow, creepy motion along the wall, and with a
gurgle of fright, Furn clutched his bedfellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky!&rdquo; he gasped thickly. &ldquo;Micky&mdash;wake
up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>McBride rolled over. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; he grunted
sleepily. &ldquo;W&rsquo;as matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost!&rdquo; shrilled Barber. &ldquo;Morford&rsquo;s
ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words penetrated to more ears than one.
Startled into complete wakefulness, McBride
bounced over and leaned out of the bunk. At the
same instant Red Garrity sat up abruptly from
a heap of blankets on the floor, and Cavanaugh
poked his head over the edge of the upper bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; they both cried at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost!&rdquo; wailed Barber. &ldquo;There beside
the window. I can see it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off with a shrill squeal of fright as
Cavvy&rsquo;s flashlight, sweeping suddenly across the
room, brought into clear relief an unmistakably
human form, lank and white-clad, looming up beside
the rough shelves that hung between the fireplace
and the window.</p>
<p>Furn&rsquo;s cry choked, died away, changing to a
surprised gasp which, in its turn was drowned in
the shout of laughter that came from the others.
For what the clear white light revealed was nothing
more spectral than the lank figure of Ted
Hinckley clad in voluminous white pajamas&mdash;he
had been the only one to so thoroughly prepare
for bed&mdash;and placidly munching the remains of
a cold baked potato.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>For a long moment he stood motionless, paying
not the slightest attention to the noise, and continuing
to eat the cold potato as if it had been
the most delicate of viands. Then, as the remaining
scouts woke and added their clamorous questioning
to the din, an odd change came over him.
He started slightly and the potato slipped unheeded
from his fingers. His eyes, already open,
widened, and into them came a dazed, bewildered
stare which merged presently into a broad, sheepish
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep-walking again, Ted?&rdquo; inquired Cavvy,
when he could get his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doggone it!&rdquo; mumbled Hinckley. &ldquo;What
the deuce was I doing, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eating a cold potato,&rdquo; chuckled Cavanaugh,
&ldquo;and scaring Furn most to death. He took you
for Morford&rsquo;s ghost. Some ghost, eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you Furny!&rdquo; laughed McBride.</p>
<p>He clutched the blushing Barber in the ribs
and created a diversion for which Furn was only
too thankful. Hinckley, chilled in his scant attire,
piled wood on the fire and hastily sought his
blankets, but it was a good while before the
chuckles died away and silence fell upon the cabin,
this time to last until morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>There was more joking then, and a good deal of
fun was poked at both Barber and Hinckley.
But the necessity of making an early start for
town cut this rather short, much to the former&rsquo;s
relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon no respectable ghost would stand
half a chance with this bunch,&rdquo; laughed McBride
as they started off. He glanced back at the cabin
which looked cheery enough now in the full glare
of the morning sun. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a swell place, fellows,
and I don&rsquo;t see why we shouldn&rsquo;t make it a regular
troop headquarters. If we could scrape up
enough money to buy some furniture and fix it up
a bit, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a scout cabin anywhere
that could beat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a half bad idea,&rdquo; agreed Cavanaugh.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we shouldn&rsquo;t do it, either.
We&rsquo;ll have to take it up with the chief on Friday
and see what he says.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">THE LOG CABIN FUND</span></h2>
<p>It was not difficult to arouse Mr. Wendell&rsquo;s
interest in the project. Always a firm believer
in over night hikes and camping trips
as the best possible means of carrying out the
scouting program, he realized at once the value of
such a place as this which could be made use of
at all seasons of the year.</p>
<p>With some of the discoverers and a number of
other scouts whose interest had been stirred up
by the tales of that first party, he made a trip up
the mountain. The cabin was viewed from every
standpoint and it was unanimously decided that
there were far too many attractive possibilities
in the building to allow it to stand there deserted
and unused. Not long afterward Mr. Wendell
and two of the troop committee visited the owner
of the land&mdash;old Morford, the builder, had been
merely a squatter&mdash;and by dint of persuasive argument
obtained permission to use the cabin as
a scout headquarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>It was too far from town to be turned into a
regular meeting place, but the troop decided to
furnish it and use it as an objective for hikes and
brief winter camping trips. It was Cavanaugh
who conceived the brilliant idea of using it also
as a place of entertainment for some of the many
soldiers from the big new Government training
camp located in the neighborhood, who constantly
thronged the town.</p>
<p>The presence of that camp and the frequent
sight of the soldiers thrilled the scouts as nothing
else could have done. It did not take them long
to know many men by sight and a few of them
intimately. The crowd first in training happened
to include a number of Western boys who had no
friends in this part of the country and were too
far from home to go back on furlough. The scouts
got into the habit, therefore, of bringing some of
these home with them for stays of varying length,
and several of the young men who had been scouts
themselves not so very long ago, revived their
interest in the movement, frequently attending
the troop meetings and even helping the busy
scoutmaster in looking after the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>From these the scouts kept secret the existence
of the cabin. They wanted to furnish and equip
it thoroughly, and then have a grand surprise
party and house warming for the soldiers. But
unfortunately all this took a good deal of time.
They might easily have filled it with odds and
ends of discarded furniture from their own homes,
but the majority voted against this. The cabin
had become the pride of their hearts, and they
wanted, as they expressed it, to do the thing right.
And so, for many weeks they worked like beavers
at every possible chore and occupation which
would bring in money for the fund, until at length
the latter reached a very decent total.</p>
<p>Bill McBride was treasurer and there were few
waking hours that he did not think with pride and
pleasure of the growing size of that canvas bag
which held their hard earned dimes and nickels.
It was in his mind one morning late in November
as he caught up sweater and books and dashed
out of the front door.</p>
<p>The air was chill, and overhead the clouds were
dark and lowering with a hint of snow in them.
But Micky was not considering the weather as
he sped along, nor was he even thinking of the
Thanksgiving holiday which loomed so pleasantly
near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got over sixty dollars,&rdquo; he said to himself
as he hastened up the street, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
see why we shouldn&rsquo;t begin pretty soon. If we
don&rsquo;t, Jack Farren and Harley and all the rest
of that corking bunch will be ordered across and
never see the cabin at all. You can get a lot of
stuff for sixty dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye&mdash;Micky!&rdquo; shrilled a voice from up a side
street. &ldquo;Wait up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>McBride glanced that way impatiently. Harry
Ritter, stout, round-faced and indolent, was approaching
at his usual lazy stroll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t, Rit, I&rsquo;m late,&rdquo; he called without pausing.</p>
<p>Whereupon, with a grunt, Ritter speeded up
and caught McBride about the middle of the next
block. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s your rush,&rdquo; he complained,
puffing a little. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t half-past eight
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, but I&rsquo;ve got to fix Mrs. Wright&rsquo;s
furnace and carry out some ashes before school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ritter sniffed. &ldquo;You still doing that?&rdquo; he inquired
disparagingly. &ldquo;You <i>are</i> an easy mark.
I&rsquo;ll bet you don&rsquo;t get a cent for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t, you mercenary young pup,&rdquo;
retorted Micky. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing it for money.
When Jim was drafted, I said I&rsquo;d look after her
chores &rsquo;till he came back. You&rsquo;re a hot scout,
you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks! When <i>I</i> work, I want something out
of it, especially with the troop needing money
like we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky chuckled. &ldquo;<i>When</i> you work!&rdquo; he repeated
with emphasis. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good one. Just
let me know when you&rsquo;re going to start, and I&rsquo;ll
come around and look on. It would be a real treat
to see you exerting yourself for once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;You go to grass! I&rsquo;ll bet I&rsquo;ve turned in as
much money to the fund as anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but you didn&rsquo;t earn it. You just
grafted it off papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ritter flushed floridly. &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted.
&ldquo;You think so, do you? That runt, Midge
Willett&rsquo;s been stuffing you full of lies. Just
wait till I give him a piece of my mind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; laughed Micky. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
any to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He skipped up a side street, leaving the stout
youth snorting incoherently on the corner. A
few houses beyond he turned in at the gate of a
small, white-painted cottage, hastened along a
gravelled path at the side, and dived into the open
cellar door.</p>
<p>When he had shaken down the small furnace,
swept up the floor and carted the ashes around
to the rear he knocked at the back door and
stepped in, closing it behind him.</p>
<p>It was an immaculate kitchen, fairly shining in
its scrubbed, polished state of cleanliness. Everything
was so spotless, in fact, that the vigorous
movements of the broom, wielded by the small,
spare woman in a limp calico dress seemed rather
unnecessary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mrs. Wright,&rdquo; said Micky,
pulling off his cap. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fixed the furnace and
carried out the ashes. I&rsquo;ll split your kindling
this afternoon after school. Is there anything I
can do for you downtown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced momentarily at him over one
shoulder. The vigorous movement of the broom
never ceased. &ldquo;No, thank you, William,&rdquo; she
said briefly.</p>
<p>Still Micky hesitated. He had noticed her reddened
eyelids and a curious, unwonted droop to
the usually erect shoulders. &ldquo;I&mdash;I thought perhaps
you might want something special from the
store,&rdquo; he persisted awkwardly. &ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s
Thanksgiving, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She faced him suddenly, her thin, rheumatic
fingers clenched about the broom handle.
&ldquo;Thanksgiving!&rdquo; she repeated harshly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that to me? What have I got to be thankful for?&rdquo;
Her lips quivered for an instant and then straightened.
&ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s going over&mdash;going to France.
And&mdash;and they won&rsquo;t let him come home to say
good-by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky drew a quick breath; for a moment the
tragedy in her eyes turned him speechless. It
hurt him, too, that look, and brought into his mind
for a vivid second the eyes of a mother fox he had
once seen, backed into a rocky corner, her frightened,
shivering cubs behind her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed sympathetically, an instant
later. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t give him leave? But&mdash;but
couldn&rsquo;t, you&mdash;go to see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could, but I&rsquo;ve got no money,&rdquo; flamed the
woman&mdash;&ldquo;and he leaves on Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abruptly she turned her back and resumed that
fierce, monotonous sweeping of the spotless floor.
Micky stared for a moment at the narrow, drooping
shoulders, the plain white collar, the soft,
pretty, grayish hair, and of a sudden something
rose in his throat and choked him. With eyelids
stinging, he reached blindly for the knob, opened
the door and stepped outside. Drawing it softly
shut, he blinked rapidly several times before he
stepped off the stone and moved slowly down the
gravelled path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough!&rdquo; he muttered gruffly&mdash;&ldquo;beastly
tough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A picture of Jim Wright flashed into his mind&mdash;laughing,
fearless, blue-eyed Jim, whose devotion
to his mother had been the only thing that
made him await the machinery of the draft. He
might have pleaded dependency, but he did not&mdash;could
not, he told Micky, who was an ardent
admirer of the older fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have every cent of my pay, Micky, old
scout,&rdquo; he explained just before leaving. &ldquo;And
with you to help her over the hard spots, I guess
she&rsquo;ll make out all right. I just can&rsquo;t stick
around home when men are needed over there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>So he had gone into training&mdash;ordered, perversely,
to a distant camp instead of one so near
at hand. And Micky had kept his promise to help
in the spirit as well as letter. Jim had been back
just once in all those months; a soldier&rsquo;s pay
doesn&rsquo;t stretch for frequent railroad journeys.
And now he is going over. It might be years before
his mother saw him again; it might be&mdash;never.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only he was at Camp Wheeling,&rdquo; growled
the boy, speeding mechanically toward school.
&ldquo;It seems too stupid to send him all that ways.
Why, the round trip costs nearly fifty dollars.&rdquo;
A remembrance of that look in the woman&rsquo;s eyes
came back to him and he ground his teeth.
&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;If I only had the
money&mdash;if I could only get some!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in a smallish town like Wharton, with everyone
feeling the effect of the war in increased
prices and voluntary self denial, fifty dollars
seemed a really enormous sum to raise at short
notice. It was not until Micky was running up
the school steps that there came to him in a sudden,
blinding flash the realization that this amount
and more already reposed in the scout treasury.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">THE APPEAL</span></h2>
<p>He stopped abruptly in the hall. But that
was their fund! That was what they
lay up, and to the spending of which they had
looked forward with such enthusiasm. For a
moment the thought of its being suddenly swept
away, of having to start all over again in that
slow, painful piling up of dimes and nickels,
seemed an intolerable, an impossible thing. But
it was only for a moment. After all, what were
chairs and tables, dishes, pots and pans, against
the hunger of a mother&rsquo;s love or the bitterness
of parting?</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s face cleared and his lips straightened.
It was the only way. And as he dashed
through the coatroom, deftly flinging cap and
sweater on a hook as he passed, and slid into
his seat just in time for roll-call, his mind was
busy working out details. The thing must be
put through swiftly or it would be too late.
Mrs. Wright really ought to leave on the four
o&rsquo;clock train that afternoon to reach Jim in time
for dinner the following day. In the meantime
the whole troop had to be won over to the scheme,
and as Micky considered the situation it seemed
to him as if Fate had conspired to make it especially
difficult.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Mr. Wendell was out of town for a few days.
Cartwright, the assistant scoutmaster, worked in
a neighboring city and would not be home until
after six. And finally Cavanaugh, whom he felt
sure would have backed him to the limit, had
gone off that very morning to spend Thanksgiving
with a relative in the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to me,&rdquo; thought the boy dubiously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to handle the whole thing. I wonder
if I can put it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced speculatively around the school
room. Champ Ferris would be easy. He was
assistant patrol leader of the Eagles and usually
followed in Micky&rsquo;s lead. Tallerico could also
probably be won over; so could Furn Barber.
But there was Clay Marshall and one or two
others who had made the fund almost their religion.
There was also Harry Ritter! And
finally one never knew how the smaller kids would
take a thing like this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>But McBride had a stubborn streak in him
which made difficulties things to be surmounted instead
of stumbling blocks. It is to be feared that
lessons were much neglected that morning, but before
the noon recess he had passed around word
to everyone that there would be a special meeting
of the troop in one of the empty class rooms
at twelve sharp. In the absence of the other officials,
McBride would have to conduct the meeting
besides acting as principal speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce is up, Micky?&rdquo; Two or three
spoke at once, as they crowded around the
teacher&rsquo;s low platform. &ldquo;Has Mr. Wendell got
back already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of. This has nothing to do
with him. It&rsquo;s about something I found out this
morning.&rdquo; McBride hesitated an instant, his
back against the desk, his eyes shifting swiftly
from one face to another. &ldquo;Jim Wright&rsquo;s sailing
for France on Saturday,&rdquo; he explained
briefly, &ldquo;and they won&rsquo;t give him home leave before
he goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a momentary pause. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t,
generally,&rdquo; commented Ted Hinckley. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard
luck though. Still, he&rsquo;s mighty keen to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One or two murmured perfunctory agreement,
but most of the boys were silent, looking with
puzzled expectancy at McBride. Champ Ferris&rsquo;
question seemed to voice the feeling of the majority.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what can we do, Micky?&rdquo; he asked at
length, in his slow, drawling manner. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
up to us&mdash;to give him a farewell present, or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky stared; then laughed oddly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you might call it that,&rdquo; he agreed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d call it a farewell present, I suppose,
though it isn&rsquo;t the sort any of you have in mind.
Listen!&rdquo; He bent forward abruptly, his face
suddenly serious. &ldquo;Jim can&rsquo;t come home, but
his mother could go to him. She wants to; she&rsquo;s
dying to. But she hasn&rsquo;t any money. You know
how poor they are. Jim&rsquo;s pay is about all she
has to get along on. And so it seemed to me&mdash;Jim&rsquo;s
an old scout and used to be in the troop&mdash;it&rsquo;s
up to us to send her there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and there came another pause.
Several of the boys looked blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it costs an awful lot to go to Camp Merrill,&rdquo;
said Clay Marshall doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does; the fare there and back is nearly
fifty dollars. And we&rsquo;ve no time to pass the
hat even if there was a chance of getting that
amount. She&rsquo;s got to leave at four this afternoon
to reach Jim on Thanksgiving. But if you
fellows are willing, we won&rsquo;t have to do that.
We&rsquo;ve got more than enough&mdash;in the treasury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took a moment for the idea to seep in. Then
a sudden murmur of protest came from the
group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, Micky!&rdquo; objected Marshall.
&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s our <i>fund</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is.&rdquo; The boy leaned back against
the worn edge of the desk, eyes sparkling, bright
color heightened. &ldquo;But what was the fund for?
Chairs, tables&mdash;<i>junk</i>! What do such things matter
when maybe it&rsquo;s the last time she&rsquo;ll ever see
Jim again? Fellows, if you&rsquo;d seen her face
when she told me this morning, I wouldn&rsquo;t have
to say a single word.&rdquo; He blinked an instant and
then glared at them defiantly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be falling
over yourselves to do what&rsquo;s really the only
decent thing&mdash;what any scout would know was
just&mdash;his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eager, compelling gaze flashed from one
doubtful, dubious face to another. Suddenly Ted
Hinckley stepped over and thumped him on the
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you, old scout,&rdquo; he said briefly.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s send her to Jim and make a good job of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; echoed Furn Barber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we can live a little longer without the
stuff we wanted,&rdquo; drawled Champ Ferris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A while!&rdquo; protested Harry Ritter, frowning.
&ldquo;But look at the time it&rsquo;s taken us to earn that
money. Why, it&rsquo;s months, almost. And it&rsquo;ll go
in a minute and we&rsquo;ll have to start all over from
the beginning. Suppose she didn&rsquo;t see him again.
Lots of other&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose it was <i>your</i> mother, and <i>you</i> were going
to France and couldn&rsquo;t come home, like Jim!&rdquo;
flamed Micky, his hands clenching. &ldquo;Would <i>you</i>
get any comfort knowing there were other men
in the same fix?&rdquo; He paused. His face relaxed
in a whimsical, appealing smile. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say
any more, fellows,&rdquo; he went on quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no
talker anyway. It&rsquo;s up to you. If you&rsquo;d rather
keep the money to furnish the cabin, all right.
But if you&rsquo;d rather&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we would, Micky!&rdquo; interrupted Midge
Willett shrilly. Midge had the reputation of being
rather tough, but he was undeniably a leader
with the younger crowd. &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t made out of
no stone. Jim&rsquo;s one dandy fellow, and I move
we let the old furniture go and send his mother
to him for a Thanksgiving present. How about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shrill chorus of approval which burst forth
left no doubt as to the feelings of the majority.
Even Clay Marshall joined in, and though Ritter
said nothing, he made no protest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; exclaimed McBride delightedly.
&ldquo;I knew you fellows would do it.
Now it&rsquo;s up to us to get a hustle on. Chase home
for the money and buy the ticket and berth and
take &rsquo;em up to Mrs. Wright. If we turned over
the coin she might balk. I&rsquo;ll be late, I s&rsquo;pose, this
afternoon, but I should worry!&rdquo; He pushed
briskly through the group, but at the door, moved
by a sudden impulse, he turned. &ldquo;Come ahead,
Rit,&rdquo; he urged abruptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll want somebody
to hold the change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ritter flushed, hesitated, and then, almost reluctantly,
came forward. Together they left the
school and sped toward the McBride house.
There the canvas bag containing their hard
earned &ldquo;fund,&rdquo; mainly in dimes, nickels and
quarters, was secured and they headed for the
station.</p>

<br /><span class="small">GOOD TURNS LIKE CHICKENS</span></h2>
<p>The ticket agent was some time counting
up the coins and making jocular comments
on their probable use of the strip
of paper he handed them in exchange. It must be
confessed that even Micky felt a momentary
qualm at the limpness of the bag that was returned
to them, but he suppressed it swiftly. Ritter
gave an involuntary sigh, but made no remark
until they had turned into the Wright yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just wait here till you&rsquo;re through,&rdquo; he said
briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not!&rdquo; rejoined McBride, catching
him firmly by an arm. &ldquo;What do you think I
brought you for? You come along with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wright sat in a rocker staring listlessly
out of the window. Her hands lay limply in her
lap, and something in the hopeless resignation of
her pose was even more eloquent than her feverish
activity of the morning. She glanced up as
the two boys entered, and Micky was smitten with
sudden embarrassment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&mdash;that is, the troop wanted to give
Jim a&mdash;a little send-off, Mrs. Wright,&rdquo; he stammered.
&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know what he wanted, so
we thought&mdash; Here!&rdquo; He thrust the bits of cardboard
into her hands hastily. &ldquo;We thought his
mother would be the best present we could send.
You&rsquo;ll have to take the four o&rsquo;clock train this
afternoon,&rdquo; he added more briskly.</p>
<p>For a moment the woman sat motionless, staring
at the printed strip in her limp fingers. Then
a word leaped into her consciousness out of the
blur of printing&mdash;a word which, since early
morning, had burned in her brain a symbol of
hopeless despair. It was merely the name of a
distant railroad station, but as she realized its
meaning the frozen look melted from her lined face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;William!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;
She stumbled to her feet and one thin arm reached
out and caught his shoulder with surprising
force. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll see Jim after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Micky gruffly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what the fellows want. You get ready and we&rsquo;ll
come up after school to carry your bag. Remember,
it&rsquo;s the four o&rsquo;clock train.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Hastily backing toward the door, the boy caught
one glimpse of a look on her face which he never
forgot. It seemed almost as if a ray of pure sunshine
shot suddenly out of the gray clouds to
stream athwart her countenance. In that instant
the haggard lines vanished, the mouth softened,
the eyes glowed with a wonderful light. Then
the door closed behind the two and they were out
in the dull November grayness again.</p>
<p>In silence they reached the street and headed
mechanically toward home. Micky&rsquo;s eyes were
fixed straight ahead with a faraway look in them
and an unconscious smile on his lips. He was
picturing to himself Jim&rsquo;s surprise and delight
when he received the &ldquo;present&rdquo; they were sending
him. Ritter&rsquo;s face was downcast. He walked
rather slouchingly, both hands in his trousers
pockets. Now and then he kicked at a stray pebble.
At the corner where their ways parted, he
stopped abruptly and raised his head, an embarrassed
flush on his round face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s going,&rdquo; he said awkwardly.
&ldquo;I&mdash;guess it won&rsquo;t take us so long after all to&mdash;to
raise that fund over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Micky grinned and
slapped him on the back. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have it in a
jiffy, what with snow coming and sidewalks to
clean and all that. Well, see you later, old kid.
We&rsquo;ve only got ten minutes left before school, but
I&rsquo;m going home to snatch some grub. I&rsquo;m
starved.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Nearly the whole troop assembled to see Mrs.
Wright off that afternoon, and the sight of the
quaint little old lady in the old fashioned bonnet
surrounded by such a throng of boys raised a good
deal of comment and speculation amongst the people
around the station. Of course she was flustered
and bewildered and almost speechless.
When she shook hands with each one of the scouts
her small, gloved hand trembled and her murmured
words of gratitude were scarcely audible.
But the look of sublime happiness in her face was
more eloquent than any words could be. It
brought a curious, tingling thrill to more than one
young heart and stirred up a sense of pride and
satisfaction at having had a share in something
more truly tangible and lasting than the most
solid furniture ever made.</p>
<p>That feeling of content lingered even after the
train had gone and only the memory remained of
a thin, lined face with tremulous lips and shining
eyes peering through a dingy window, and a neat,
gloved hand waving a scrap of handkerchief with
a vehemence they felt instinctively would continue
long after the station and the town had disappeared
from view.</p>
<p>The eyes of the majority were still fixed upon
the train, growing smaller in the distance, when
a jovial, booming voice suddenly broke the spell
and brought them back to earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, seeing somebody off?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>McBride glanced quickly around to meet the
smiling gaze of Mr. Baker, one of their troop
committee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mrs. Wright.
Jim&rsquo;s regiment&rsquo;s ordered to France and he
couldn&rsquo;t get leave. She&rsquo;s going to&mdash;spend
Thanksgiving with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim going to France! Well! well! That&rsquo;s
pretty sudden, isn&rsquo;t it? Still, they&rsquo;re sending &rsquo;em
over all the time. I&rsquo;m glad his mother could
make the trip. She&rsquo;ll feel a lot more comfortable
after he&rsquo;s gone. By the way, how&rsquo;s the cabin
coming on? Got it furnished yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky flushed faintly and more than one boy
exchanged glances with a neighbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, sir,&rdquo; returned McBride. &ldquo;We&mdash;we
had to use some of our furnishing fund for&mdash;something
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Baker
with bluff heartiness. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you boys
shouldn&rsquo;t have the stuff we used in the Business
Men&rsquo;s Club. Ever since we gave up the room a
couple of months ago, it&rsquo;s all been stored in my
barn doing no good to anybody. There&rsquo;s some
big leather chairs and a long table, and a couple
of fur rugs, and&mdash; Oh, yes, that big moosehead,
you know, and some other horns. Those ought
to fit your place first rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ripple of excitement ran through the group.
Micky&rsquo;s eyes shone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee-whiz!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;d be&mdash;they&rsquo;d
be&mdash; We never dreamed of anything so
corking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; boomed Mr. Baker, buttoning his overcoat
around his portly form. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call it
settled, then. I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t think
of it before. The things are just gathering dust
and moths where they are. You boys come over
any time and pick out what you want and I&rsquo;ll
have it carted up to the cabin.&rdquo; With a wave
of his hand he started briskly down the station
platform. Then he looked back. &ldquo;Come over
this afternoon, if you want to,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be home after five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrilled, dazed, with eyes shining, they stared
after his retreating figure in silence. If at that
moment their English teacher, Miss Brown, had
requested the definition of an angel, there would
undoubtedly have flashed into the brains of nine-tenths
of the group the picture of a stout, broad
individual snugly buttoned into a brown overcoat
and wearing a black derby hat. Then he
turned the corner of the building and the tension
laxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled Champ Ferris smilingly,
&ldquo;they say that good deeds like chickens come
home to roost. Looks as if good turns did, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">THE FACE IN THE WINDOW</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go back,&rdquo; grumbled Harry Ritter,
petulantly swishing at the brittle
stalk of a leafless brier. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
black walnut trees around here, and it&rsquo;ll be dark
in half an hour. We have supper early to-night,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking of his bread-basket as usual,&rdquo;
grinned McBride. &ldquo;It would do you good, Rit,
to go without supper for once. You need thinning
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thin enough to suit me,&rdquo; sniffed the fat
chap. He cocked a troubled eye at the cold, gray
clouds which hung low above the narrow country
road. &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s going to rain or snow
before long,&rdquo; he added with a shiver.</p>
<p>McBride laughed carelessly. &ldquo;We should
worry and get a wrinkle! A little wet won&rsquo;t hurt
any of us. I move we keep going for a while
longer, anyhow. We&rsquo;ve had rotten luck this afternoon.
If we don&rsquo;t look out Marshall&rsquo;s bunch
will get ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>In this final clean-up for locating trees not previously
reported for the census of black walnuts
requested by the Government, Mr. Wendell had
hit upon the expedient of dividing the troop into
miscellaneous groups of four and offering a prize
to the group reporting the greatest number. The
emulation and friendly rivalry aroused had produced
fine results. So far Jim Cavanaugh&rsquo;s
group was ahead, but the scouts under Clay Marshall&rsquo;s
leadership had lately been creeping up.
At McBride&rsquo;s remark, Ritter sniffed scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you expect?&rdquo; he complained in an
aggrieved tone. &ldquo;Walnuts don&rsquo;t grow in a
wild country like this. They&rsquo;re always around
farms or on main roads. It was a dirty trick of
Mr. Wendell to make us come way over here.
Where&rsquo;d Marshall&rsquo;s bunch go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over around Benson&rsquo;s Hill,&rdquo; answered Cavanaugh,
his gaze wandering keenly over the gaunt,
bare tree tops of the surrounding woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right near the cabin!&rdquo; exclaimed Ritter
enviously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet they&rsquo;ve gone in there and
built a fire and are having a dandy time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then they can&rsquo;t be finding walnuts and
beating our record,&rdquo; retorted Micky. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
one thing anyhow, fellows. When this last clean-up
is over, I&rsquo;ll bet nobody&rsquo;ll be able to find a black
walnut tree with a fine tooth comb around this
country. We&rsquo;ve located a raft of &rsquo;em since we
started last summer.&rdquo; He sighed, and his mind
reverted to another subject. &ldquo;Gee! The cabin
certainly looks swell with all that new stuff in it.
When are we going to have that house-warming
Cavvy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavanaugh turned abruptly and stared blankly
at his friend. &ldquo;Say! I clean forgot to tell you
something. Did you hear about Jack Farren?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s down in the camp hospital with scarlet
fever. I met Dick Harley in town this morning
and he told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! That&rsquo;s tough luck, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not the worst,&rdquo; continued Cavvy.
&ldquo;Dick says they&rsquo;re likely to get marching orders
any day, and of course if they sail for France
before Jack gets well, he&rsquo;ll be left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McBride gave a long, expressive whistle.
&ldquo;That would be the extreme limit, wouldn&rsquo;t it?
It&rsquo;s a shame. Jack&rsquo;s one of the dandiest chaps
I ever met. He&rsquo;d be all broken up to have them
go and&mdash;What&rsquo;s the matter? See one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavanaugh shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; he returned,
his eyes fixed on the naked branches of
some tall trees towering up above the smaller
growth quite a distance from the road. &ldquo;They
look pretty good to me, though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t look bad,&rdquo; agreed Micky, swinging
the stout hickory stick he had cut and trimmed
earlier in the afternoon. &ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t
tell for sure at this distance, but they&rsquo;re worth
looking up. Wonder how you get in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavanaugh was already pushing into the undergrowth
that edged the road. &ldquo;This is the
only way, I guess,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be
so very far back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet they&rsquo;re hickory or butternut,&rdquo;
grumbled Ritter pessimistically.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he followed the others into the
tangled wilderness of briers, bushes and young
trees which seemed to extend indefinitely over this
remote and unfamiliar section of Fairview
County.</p>
<p>As he plodded along over marshy ground to
which belated winter had brought only a thin
crusting of frost, the stout chap wished fervently
that he had found some excuse for evading the
excursion this afternoon. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been
easy, for Cavvy had a way of keeping the fellows
up to the mark, but he might have managed if he
had only had the sense, and then all this unpleasantness
would have been avoided.</p>
<p>At length his growing petulance and inward
stewing broke forth into audible grumbling.
Nothing pleased him, even the discovery of a narrow
path winding through the overgrown swamp,
which, since it led in the general direction they
were going, Cavvy promptly followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;An old cow path, I&rsquo;ll bet,&rdquo; growled Ritter,
tenderly caressing a long scratch across one check.
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take us anywhere. Whoever heard of
walnut trees growing in this kind of a beastly hole.
We&rsquo;re just wasting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, jaw sagging, and stared over the
shoulder of Champ Ferris, who walked ahead of
him. The woods had ended abruptly in a
cluttered, overgrown clearing. Across this the
path wavered diagonally through dead, rustling
grass and weeds nearly waist high to a house surrounded
by eight or ten magnificent black walnut
trees.</p>
<p>At the sight of them Cavvy&rsquo;s eyes gleamed
triumphantly. &ldquo;By jingo!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;What <i>beauties</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>McBride and Ferris echoed his enthusiasm, and
there was a hurried forward movement. Then,
inexplicably, they paused. In that first moment
there had been eyes for nothing save the objects
of their search. But now, as their glances
wandered from the great trees and took in the
other details of the clearing, there came suddenly
over each one of them an impression of loneliness
and desolation and decay which was almost chilling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>The house was large and rambling, but bore
a hundred signs of neglect and disuse. The paint
had scaled from its surface leaving it a dark,
streaked gray. In the moss-covered, sagging roof
were rotting holes. Shutters covered the windows
or hung crazily by a single rusted hinge. A
pillar of the porch in front had fallen and lay
buried in the tall grass.</p>
<p>At one side of the house lay a stagnant pool
covered with a thin film of ice, and a quantity of
green slime. Beyond it loomed the gaunt outlines
of a great barn. The roof had been almost
stripped of shingles, and the beams and rafters
stood out against the cold gray sky like the
bleached ribs of some long-wrecked ship.
Farther still they could glimpse stretches of what
had once been pasture land, but which now was
smothered in a thick tangle of brier and bay and
juniper. The view was limited on every side
by thick, encompassing woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; breathed Champ Ferris. &ldquo;What a
hole! It gives you a regular chill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a job finding the
owner,&rdquo; said McBride disconsolately. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
look as if anybody&rsquo;d lived here in a thousand
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavvy&rsquo;s face was puzzled. &ldquo;But the path,&rdquo;
he reminded them. &ldquo;Why hasn&rsquo;t that grown up
like the rest if it isn&rsquo;t used?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is queer,&rdquo; agreed McBride. &ldquo;Of course
it might be some short cut, but&mdash; What the deuce
is the matter with you, Rit?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>A sharp, half smothered exclamation from the
stout chap made them all turn quickly, but for
a moment Ritter did not answer. With jaw sagging
and eyes wide and startled, he was staring
at one of the grimy windows on the upper floor
of the gray house from which, a second before,
he had glimpsed a face peering down at them.</p>
<p>A heavy, pendulous face it was, of a curious
and pronounced pallor. It hovered there for an
instant and disappeared so swiftly that Cavanaugh,
following the direction of Ritter&rsquo;s frightened
gaze, was in time to catch only the white
flash of its vanishing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">THE MAN WITH NO HAIR</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There is someone there, after all, then!&rdquo;
exclaimed Cavvy quickly. &ldquo;What did
he look like, Rit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ritter&rsquo;s gaze, still wide and nervous, swept
along the row of broken or shuttered windows,
returning quickly to the one near the corner.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, exactly,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;White and fat and&mdash;and sort of queer looking.
Let&rsquo;s get out of here, fellows. This beastly place
gives me the creeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t go without finding out about
the trees,&rdquo; protested McBride. &ldquo;It would be a
shame to let them go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it would,&rdquo; agreed Cavvy impatiently.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to&mdash; Well, now what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ritter started slightly and withdrew his wandering
gaze from the gaunt outlines of the great
barn. &ldquo;N&mdash;nothing,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I thought
I&mdash;saw something&mdash;moving down there, but I
guess I didn&rsquo;t. What are you going to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Knock at the door and ask him if he&rsquo;s willing
to sell his trees for Government use,&rdquo; returned
Cavanaugh tersely. &ldquo;Nobody can eat us
for doing that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stout chap sighed deeply, but made no
actual reply. It was with very evident distaste,
however, that he followed the others past the pool
and on through the tall grass to the front porch.</p>
<p>The wooden steps were rotted into fragments,
and as the boys scrambled up without their aid,
they felt the old flooring give dangerously under
their feet. The door itself seemed strong enough,
however. Though streaked and weathered and
bare of paint, it sounded hard and firm under the
vigorous rapping of Cavanaugh&rsquo;s knuckles.</p>
<p>The knock echoed curiously, with hollow, prolonged
reverberations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds empty,&rdquo; remarked Cavvy, intently
listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Rit&rsquo;s stomach,&rdquo; grinned Micky, giving
Ritter a sudden poke in that region which made
him jump nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any sense?&rdquo; he snapped irritably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> empty,&rdquo; spoke up Champ Ferris suddenly.
He had been peering curiously through a
broken pane in the narrow window beside the
door. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a darn thing in the hall that
I can see but a couple of boxes and a mess of
dirt and rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Cavanaugh waited a few moments and then
knocked again. By this time the silence and desolation
of the place was beginning to wear upon
the spirits of others than Ritter. A frankly deserted
house often has interesting possibilities.
But this gloomy ruin, so far from the unfrequented
road, that appeared to be the hiding place
of a mysterious unknown, was something quite
different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny,&rdquo; commented Cavvy presently, in an
unconsciously lowered tone. &ldquo;He must have
heard that. I wonder why he doesn&rsquo;t answer....
Well, suppose we try the back door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the sagging porch and circled the
house in silence. The path ran along this side
and was the only thing which showed the slightest
trace of use. Everything else was overgrown
with grass and weeds.</p>
<p>The path ended at the rear door, and here, too
were more black walnuts. There was also a great
pine, one of the largest they had ever seen, which
towered up not a dozen feet from the house. Its
huge trunk actually touched the wall of a decrepit
woodshed, while the lower branches swept
across the roof of the main building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a corking tree,&rdquo; said Cavvy admiringly.
&ldquo;But what a crazy place to plant it. It&rsquo;s
a wonder to me there&rsquo;s any roof left at all, with
the needles and all to rot it. The fellow who did
it must have been some nut.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Regular wal-nut,&rdquo; murmured Micky from
force of habit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; groaned Cavanaugh. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you pull
off anything better than that? Besides, it&rsquo;s the
pine I&rsquo;m talking about. Here; give us that club
of yours,&rdquo; he went on, taking Micky&rsquo;s hickory
staff. &ldquo;Maybe I can raise him with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clatter he made would certainly have roused
anyone but a deaf person, but apparently it had
no effect whatever on the eccentric occupant of
the old house. When the hollow echoes died
away, all four boys stood motionless, fairly holding
their breath as they listened for the sound of
footsteps inside. But none came, and presently
Cavvy, backing away a little, stared curiously up
at the dingy, slatternly windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got me,&rdquo; he said with a touch of petulance.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why the dickens a man wouldn&rsquo;t
answer a knock at his own door, unless&mdash; Jingo!
I wonder if he would be hiding from something?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it!&rdquo; put in Ritter in a shrill, nervous
whisper. &ldquo;How do we know he isn&rsquo;t a
criminal, or&mdash;or an escaped lunatic, who&rsquo;s broken
in here perhaps? Maybe he&rsquo;s not the owner of
the house at all. Let&rsquo;s beat it, Cavvy. We&rsquo;re
just wasting time, and it&rsquo;ll be pouring in a little
while. I felt a drop on my face just now.&rdquo;
Cavanaugh did not answer. His own face, still
upturned, had taken on an oddly intent, curiously
puzzled stare. His gaze, no longer focussed on
the windows, had shifted to a point just under the
sagging eaves where a long branch of the pine
tree stretched across the roof, seeming almost to
touch the rotting shingles.</p>
<p>Suddenly his face flushed, his lips half parted,
a look at once eager and incredulous flashed into
his widening eyes. Swiftly those eager eyes followed
the limb to where it joined the massive
trunk, then darted upward to the point at which
that trunk disappeared in a baffling mask of dark
green foliage. Then, of a sudden, there came the
grating of a key and the door beside them was
flung abruptly open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; snarled a voice. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
with you? What do you mean trying to pound
a man&rsquo;s door down like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ritter gasped and stepped swiftly backward,
treading on Ferris&rsquo;s toes. Cavanaugh whirled
about, unconsciously tightening his grip on the
stick he held. Even Micky felt an unpleasant tingling
on his spine as he met the shifting glance of
the individual in the doorway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>There was something oddly repellant about the
man&mdash;something to be felt, in that first moment,
rather than defined. He was big beyond the ordinary,
but with a flabby, unwholesome bulk that
reminded one of a jellyfish. His hands were soft
and pudgy; his clothes hung about him like shapeless
bags.</p>
<p>All this and more they swiftly noted without
hitting on the feature which roused that curious
repulsion. Then suddenly they saw. The creature
had no hair! His shiny scalp was bare of
any vestige; he had no eyebrows or eyelashes.
The flesh which hung about his pendulous jowls
in pasty, yellow rolls was as innocent of a beard
as any baby&rsquo;s. Moreover, his eyes&mdash;gray they
were and very small and pale&mdash;stared unwinking,
the hairless lids so narrowed that an alien
roll of flesh showed there, making those lids look
double.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; repeated the fat man, as
the four stared at him without speaking. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t
you got voices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter,&rdquo; returned Stafford,
recovering his self-possession. &ldquo;We came
to find out if you&rsquo;d be willing to sell your trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fishy eyes widened abruptly. &ldquo;Trees?&rdquo;
shrilled the man. &ldquo;Trees?&rdquo; For an instant his
gaze flashed upward. &ldquo;What do you mean?
Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re boy scouts from Wharton,&rdquo; Stafford
explained quietly, keeping his eyes fixed intently
on the pasty, pudgy face. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been ordered
by the Government to make a census of all the
black walnut trees whose owners are willing to
sell. The wood is needed for gun stocks and airplane
propellers. You&rsquo;ll get a good price, and be
doing a service to your country at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, walnut trees! That&rsquo;s all you want?
Gunstocks? You&rsquo;re sure? Well, I won&rsquo;t sell.
The&mdash;nuts are too valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind any buts,&rdquo; cut in the fat man
harshly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you, and that&rsquo;s enough. I&rsquo;ll
remind you, also, that this is private property and
you&rsquo;re trespassing. The sooner you get off it the
better I&rsquo;ll be pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further comment he closed the door
with a slam, leaving the boys to stare at one another
with wry faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet temper,&rdquo; commented McBride. &ldquo;Regular
merry little sunshine, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be <i>made</i> to turn over those trees
for Government use,&rdquo; exclaimed Champ Ferris
hotly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s a regular pro&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come ahead and let&rsquo;s get out of here,&rdquo; interrupted
Cavanaugh hastily. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t sell,
and that&rsquo;s the end of it. No use wasting any
more time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>He turned quickly from the door and led the
way toward the path. At the corner of the house
he paused for a second to send back a sharp,
searching glance at the great pine tree beside
the woodshed. Then he passed on, striding
briskly along the path without so much as a backward
look at the dreary gray house standing out
against a background of equally dreary sky.</p>
<p>He entered the fringe of undergrowth that
edged the clearing, passed thence into the stretch
of woods and kept steadily on for several hundred
yards. Then he stopped suddenly and faced
the others, his expression alert and eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, fellows,&rdquo; he said abruptly, in low
swift tones. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong back
there. Did you notice that pine tree by the
shed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. It&rsquo;s the biggest one I ever saw,&rdquo; answered
Micky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about its size,&rdquo; went on
Cavanaugh hastily. &ldquo;You remember the long
limb that runs over the roof? Close by the house
there&rsquo;s a branch that&rsquo;s lately been broken off and
hangs down&mdash;probably in the storm yesterday.
Well, just under the eaves at a point where that
branch must have covered them&mdash;two wires come
out and run over to the big limb!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">THE HIDDEN WIRELESS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Wires!&rdquo; exclaimed McBride and
Ferris together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, wires. They come out of
a little hole that&rsquo;s been bored through the clapboards.
Unless I miss my guess they run along
that big limb and on up the tree trunk. Does
that mean anything to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great guns!&rdquo; exclaimed Micky excitedly.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a&mdash;wireless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I do mean. You know
as well as I do that ever since the U-boats showed
up along the coast last summer, they&rsquo;ve suspected
that a hidden wireless was giving them information
about ships and things. Don&rsquo;t you
remember the talk Mr. Wendell gave at the meeting
a few weeks ago when he said that secret service
men were busy hunting for it, but it was like
looking for a needle in a haystack? He told us we
must report the least thing that seemed suspicious.
Jove! If this should be it, and we should
the ones to find it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hated that fat man from the first,&rdquo; said Ritter
viciously. &ldquo;I was sure there was something
queer about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is, all right,&rdquo; agreed Cavvy with conviction.
&ldquo;If he isn&rsquo;t running a secret wireless,
he&rsquo;s doing something else underhand. Otherwise
why is he living in this tumbledown ruin
away from everything? Why didn&rsquo;t he answer
our knocking until we pretty near broke the door
down? There&rsquo;s something crooked about him,
you can bank on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee-whiz! I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;re right, Cavvy!&rdquo; exclaimed
McBride. &ldquo;What are you going to do?
Tell Mr. Wendell, or the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavanaugh&rsquo;s face took on a faintly troubled expression.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we can do either just
yet,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You see, we really don&rsquo;t
<i>know</i> anything. There&rsquo;s nothing but those wires
to go on. If I could only get up that tree I&rsquo;d be
sure one way or another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Ferris quickly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be sure to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not after dark,&rdquo; returned Cavvy pointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; protested Ritter, his face falling.
&ldquo;Wait all that time! Why, it&rsquo;d be ages. And
we&rsquo;d probably get wet to the skin. The rain
can&rsquo;t hold off much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;You give me a pain, Rit,&rdquo; said Micky scathingly.
&ldquo;What the dickens does a little rain matter
when we&rsquo;ve got a chance like this? You
oughtn&rsquo;t to howl. You&rsquo;re so well padded you
wouldn&rsquo;t feel it. Besides, it won&rsquo;t be long at all.
It&rsquo;ll be good and dark by half past five on a night
like this. I&rsquo;m game to stay, Cavvy. So&rsquo;s Champ,
aren&rsquo;t you, old kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ferris acquiesced, though not quite with McBride&rsquo;s
eager impulsiveness. The woods were
cold and dreary and the possibilities ahead of
them did not fill him with delight. But he was
too keen an admirer of Jimmy Cavanaugh to
risk losing the other&rsquo;s good opinion. Finally,
with the other three against him, Ritter gave in,
though with much grumbling and complaint, and
a good deal more secret apprehension, and leaving
the path they found a more secluded spot
back in the undergrowth in which to pass their
vigil.</p>
<p>This did not prove so long or so tedious as some
of them expected. They were wrought-up and
excited, and there were plans to make and possibilities
to discuss. Moreover, the early twilight,
hastened by the lowering clouds, fell swiftly.
Long before six it was quite dark. Twenty minutes
later Cavvy decided that it was time to move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>Cautiously they crept out of the bushes and felt
their way along the path. It was spooky business,
this stealing through the darkness, and more than
one heart beat faster at the thought of what might
lie before them. At the edge of the clearing
they paused, trying to make out the lines of the
old house through the gloom. A cold sleety drizzle
had begun to fall, and with a shiver Ritter
turned up his mackinaw collar.</p>
<p>Cavanaugh, in advance, took a few more steps
forward and then stopped again. Of a sudden,
out of the blackness before them, came a faint,
wavering glow of light. For a second or two
they failed to place it. Then the vague outlines
of a window sprang up in the darkness, only to
fade again as the light flickered, died out, to reappear
presently in another window on the upper
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s moving around up there,&rdquo; whispered
Cavvy. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s safe enough. Champ, you
and Rit stay here. Better get off the path a little;
he might come out. Mind you don&rsquo;t run into the
pond. Come ahead, Micky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ritter and Ferris stumbled gropingly from the
path, the former giving another shudder at the
thought of blundering into that slimy pool. The
other two disappeared instantly into the shadows.</p>
<p>They moved cautiously, and as they neared the
house even their occasional stealthy whispers
ceased. The light remained stationary in the
window near the corner where they had first
glimpsed the fat man&rsquo;s face. This was no proof
that he also was there, but some chance had to
be taken, and Micky found no slight comfort in
the heft of the stout stick in his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>At the rear of the building, under the shadow
of the great pine, not a ray of light relieved the
gloom. The boys felt their way past the closed
door and on to the woodshed. Here McBride
helped his friend to the low roof and then retired
a little way to keep watch according to agreement.</p>
<p>Slowly and carefully Cavanaugh edged his way
along the roof, thankful for the rubber soles which
gave him some slight hold on the slippery surface.
Without them he would certainly have slid
off, for there was nothing to take hold of with his
hands, and he had constantly to feel ahead for
holes and weak spots in the rotten shingles.</p>
<p>Reaching the tree, he stood upright, steadying
himself against the trunk. He had noted that
afternoon the projecting stub of a broken limb
which gave him his first foothold. Thence, with
the aid of a similar butt and a curious, unexpected
projection which felt like a wooden cleat nailed
to the trunk, he gained the lowest crotch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>It was ticklish business, climbing through the
dark with only his sense of feeling to guide him,
and Cavvy breathed a sigh of relief as he threw
one leg across the solid branch. A moment later
his fingers touched the wires and his heart leaped
exultingly. There they were exactly as he had
imagined them&mdash;two heavy insulated wires snugly
fastened to the limb with staples, and in such a
position as to be quite invisible from the ground.
His eager fingers traced them to the trunk where
they turned upward just as he thought they might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a wireless!&rdquo; he muttered excitedly.
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">MICKY DISAPPEARS</span></h2>
<p>Without delay he resumed climbing.
There were other big limbs at frequent
intervals which made this
easier. Presently a heavy mass of fragrant pine
brushed his face. A moment later his groping
hand touched another wooden cleat nailed to the
trunk, and a little exploration convinced him that
this was the bottom rung of a rough ladder which
led directly into the treetop.</p>
<p>And there, at last, he found what he was looking
for. Far above the level of the house roof,
and completely hidden by the thick foliage, was
a small, wooden platform. That it was near the
top of the tree Cavvy knew from the swaying of
the limbs about him and the chill beat of sleet
against his face. There were ropes here and a
sort of rigging, the purpose of which puzzled him
until his searching fingers encountered the shaft
of a slim, tough pole which seemed to be held in
place by a series of u-shaped iron bands driven
into the trunk. At a point about on a level with
his head as he stood on the platform, the wires left
the trunk and continued upward along the pole
with a good deal of looseness and play; and of a
sudden an explanation of the whole ingenious apparatus
came to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>The pole must hold the wireless aerials. It
could not be placed permanently in the treetop
for the simple reason that it would project above
the branches and in the daytime be visible for a
long distance. Hence this device for lowering it
except at night, the pole simply slipped down
through the irons and held by them close to the
trunk of the tree on the opposite side from the
ladder. When darkness fell it could be hoisted
without danger. And it was at night, of course,
that those treacherous messages of information or
warning were sent to the enemy U-boats, for
Wharton was within easy reach of the coast, and
it would be a poor wireless indeed which could
not transmit many times that distance.</p>
<p>In spite of the cold sleet and drenching rain
that beat upon him, Cavanaugh felt a glow of
mingled triumph and anger at his discovery. It
seemed as if he could not reach the ground swiftly
enough so eager was he to start rolling the ball
which would end in the capture of this traitor
and perhaps his confederates. In vastly less time
than it had taken him to make the slow ascent,
he reached the bottom crotch and scrambled to
the shed roof. Without waiting for McBride&rsquo;s
help, he hung by his hands and dropped. Then
he tip-toed over to the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Micky!&rdquo; he whispered, a thrill of excitement
quivering even in his carefully lowered voice.
&ldquo;Micky! I&rsquo;ve found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer. Surprised and puzzled,
Cavvy took a step or two forward through the
darkness and his outstretched hand suddenly
touched the casing of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky!&rdquo; he repeated, this time a little louder.
&ldquo;Where the dickens are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still no answer came, and the boy turned away
with a muttered exclamation of irritation. &ldquo;He
must have gone back to the others,&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;Funny thing for him to do, but of course that&rsquo;s
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily circling the house, he groped his way
to the point as nearly as he could find it where
Ritter and Ferris had left the path. A backward
glance showed him the dim light still burning in
the corner room, and he called the boys&rsquo; names
in a guarded but penetrating whisper. The response
was instant, and in a moment they stood
beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Micky here?&rdquo; asked Cavanaugh quickly.
&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; returned Ferris. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he with
you? I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen him, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since you two went off together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>Cavvy stood silent for a moment, fighting back
the vague, yet persistent feeling of alarm which
was stealing over him. There must be some
simple explanation for McBride&rsquo;s disappearance,
but what was it? At any rate this new development
upset all his calculations. He had planned
to hasten back at once to Wharton and report his
discovery so that authorities might lose no time
in coming out to capture the wireless spy. But
that was impossible now. No matter what lay in
the balance, he could not bring himself to leave
this desolate place without finding out what had
happened to his friend. He tried to think, but all
the time that nagging sense of anxiety and misgiving
grew stronger. Suddenly his jaw squared
and his chin went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, fellows,&rdquo; he said abruptly. &ldquo;You two
will have to go back to town and bring help. I
don&rsquo;t know what the dickens has happened to
Micky. He just seems to have disappeared. I
left him by the back door while I climbed the tree,
and when I came down he was gone. He may
have slipped off to take a snoop around the house,
but we can&rsquo;t all go and leave him, especially since
there is a wireless up that tree, and you know
what kind of men would be running a thing like
that these days. So I&rsquo;ll stay here and look
around, and you hustle back as quick as you can
and get hold of somebody to come out here. You
needn&rsquo;t go all the way to town if you can dig up
two or three men at any of the farms along the
road. But they&rsquo;ve got to be men you can depend
on. Get me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Y-y-yes,&rdquo; stammered Ritter, his teeth chattering
audible. &ldquo;B-b-but what about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me; I&rsquo;ll be all right. Now
hustle; and for Pete&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t lose any time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obediently they started off; then Ferris ran
back. &ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; he said hastily. &ldquo;A little
while ago we heard a car out on the road. It
slowed down, but we couldn&rsquo;t tell whether it
stopped, or whether the trees muffled the sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A car?&rdquo; repeated Cavvy thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Humph! Of course it might be just a farmer&rsquo;s
jitney passing; it&rsquo;s not really very late. Better
be careful when you get out on the road, though.
This guy must have someone or other to bring
him news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ferris nodded, and without further comment
turned and vanished into the shadows. Listening
intently, Cavanaugh heard the faint rustle of their
hurried passage through the bushes. Then silence
fell&mdash;a silence utter and complete and different,
somehow, in its quality from the silence of
even a few moments before. He was alone now&mdash;yet
not alone. Somewhere in that spooky ruin
of a house mystery and danger lurked. He felt
it in every breath he drew, and it needed a distinct
effort of will to force himself into action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>But there was nothing else to do. He could
not stop here; he must begin at once to search for
his missing friend. Slowly he approached the
house and circled it. At the back door he paused
and whispered Micky&rsquo;s name. There was no answer,
nor did he, curiously, seem to expect one.
He took a step or two forward, his eyes, by this
time accustomed to the darkness, sweeping the
shadowy outlines of the house and shed. Then
his foot struck something on the ground and bending
down he picked up a stout stick which lay
there in the tall grass.</p>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s stick! He knew the heft and feel of it,
and a fresh wave of apprehension swept over him.
Why should Micky have dropped it here after
carrying it with him all afternoon?</p>
<p>And then, as he stood there motionless, his heart
began to throb suffocatingly. A faint scraping
sound had come to him, and in another moment
he realized that the door beside him was slowly,
silently opening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>
<p>Slowly, silently, inch by inch the portal
widened. Beyond that first faint scraping
sound, not the slightest creak accompanied
the stealthy movement. Cavanaugh, flattened
against the house wall, simply saw the black
shadow of the door as it swung outward, growing
imperceptibly wider against the almost equally
dark background behind it. It was almost as if
the thing were happening without human agency;
and to the boy, already keyed up by the strange
doings of the night, the suspense became well nigh
intolerable.</p>
<p>He longed to shout, to dash forward, to run
away&mdash;to do anything which would end that desperate
tension. The thudding of his heart suffocated
him; he felt sure the sound was audible for
yards. It was only by digging teeth painfully
into under lip that he was able to keep a precarious
hold on himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Then all at once he saw a blurred white patch
against the shadow of the door&mdash;a hand resting
on the latch. His own fingers gripped the hickory
staff with unconscious force; his muscles stiffened.
A faint rustling beat on his taut nerves with a
sense of actual physical shock. What was coming?
Who was coming? Could it possibly be
McBride? Or was it that beastly fat man with
the pasty, yellow, hairless face?</p>
<p>The question pounded through his brain, and
then suddenly was answered. Another blurred
white patch showed in the darkness, larger than
the other and higher up&mdash;much higher than
Micky&rsquo;s face would have appeared. And Cavvy
staring with wide, straining eyes, seemed to
glimpse the vague, shadowy outlines of a broad,
bulky figure standing almost at his elbow. The
head was thrust slightly forward, the face moved
in a slow circle as if the man were making a
stealthy survey of the yard.</p>
<p>It was too much for Cavanaugh. In that instant
his self-control snapped like a taut rope
when the strain becomes too great. The stick
flashed up and fell, with every ounce of his young
strength behind the blow. There was a grunt, a
groan. He struck again, frenziedly, but already
the tall figure was reeling. In another instant it
thudded to the ground and, with a gasp of horror,
Cavvy came to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>For a second he stood there shaking, the stick
dangling from his laxed fingers. Then he drew
a long, shuddering breath and one hand lifted
mechanically to wipe the moisture, which was
more than rain, from his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have killed him,&rdquo; he muttered in a
frightened whisper. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t possible!&rdquo; And
then: &ldquo;But suppose I have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping swiftly on his knees beside the motionless
body, he had another shock. He found one
of the limp hands and was fumbling desperately
for the pulse, when all at once he realized that
the wrist he held wasn&rsquo;t in the least fleshy. On
the contrary it was lean and hard, and terminated
in a big, muscular hand. The person he had
struck down was not the fat man at all!</p>
<p>Cavvy gasped and dropped the hand. Then he
reached for it again and deliberately forced himself
to find the pulse. When he felt it fluttering
beneath his fingers, he gave a sigh of relief and
slowly his composure began to return.</p>
<p>At least the worst hadn&rsquo;t happened. He was
in a tight place, to be sure; the stranger might
regain consciousness at any moment, and it behooved
him to act quickly. But he could think
and act now without the handicap of that numbing
horror which had come so near to undoing him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Crouching in the wet grass, he glanced swiftly
over one shoulder through the open door. It was
dark inside, though not so dark as out of doors.
He made out dimly the shadowy proportions of
a wide, empty hall which seemed to run straight
through the house from front to rear. Part way
down its length stairs ascended. He could just
distinguish the upper portion of the banisters, as
if a light from one of the rooms above was shining
through an open door. And listening intently,
he could hear the sound of someone stirring there,
accompanied by a curious scraping clink of metal
striking against metal.</p>
<p>Evidently the person above had failed to hear
the fall, and, reassured, Cavanaugh felt in his
pocket and drew forth a match box. There came
with it some lengths of stout cord he always kept
in his scout suit, but these fell to the ground unheeded.
Cautiously striking a match, he cupped
his hands around it until the wood was well alight.
Then he bent forward, holding the flame close to
the face of the man lying before him.</p>
<p>It was a square, powerful face with a heavy
jaw and chin, and a hard curve to the wide, close-lipped
mouth. Even with the eyes closed, there
was a certain harsh ruthlessness about it which
made Cavvy shiver apprehensively. What would
happen when he came to his senses, as he was
likely to do at any moment?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>The match went out, but not before Cavvy had
noticed the lengths of cord and realized their possibilities.
Hastily picking them up, he turned the
man over with some difficulty so that he lay upon
his face. Five minutes later he had tied the
fellow&rsquo;s wrists firmly behind his back and made
his ankles fast. Then he straightened up and
wiped the perspiration from his forehead.</p>
<p>His mind was in turmoil of doubt and fear and
uncertainty. Up to this moment he had acted
almost entirely on impulse&mdash;an impulse born of
nervous fright and the sense of self preservation.
He felt certain that in another moment the man
would have discovered him and so he had struck
instinctively. But now that the tension had relaxed
for a moment he did not know what to do.</p>
<p>More than anything else he wanted desperately
to get away as quickly as he could and follow
Ferris and Ritter back to town where the whole
business could be turned over to the proper authorities.
He had had more than enough of meddling
with anything so fraught with risk and
danger as this proved to be, and he blamed himself
bitterly for not realizing at first how things
were likely to turn out.</p>
<p>But there was Micky. His strange disappearance
and the discovery of his stick beside the
door made Cavanaugh feel almost certain that
his friend was in the house. Remembering what
Ferris had said about the motor car that slowed
down, he wondered whether the occupant, who
might easily have been one of the gang of spies,
might not have come suddenly upon McBride and
made him a prisoner. The wind and rain up there
in the tree top would easily have drowned any
sounds of a slight scuffle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>At all events Cavvy couldn&rsquo;t make up his mind
to run away and leave his friend. He didn&rsquo;t
want to venture into that spooky house at all,
but he felt that he must at least make a reconnoiter
and find out whether what he suspected was
true or not.</p>
<p>He glanced again at the man on the grass.
The fellow was breathing heavily, but showed no
other signs of returning consciousness. With a
long breath, Cavvy gripped the stick tightly in
one hand and stepping over the sprawling body
he cautiously crossed the threshold. Noiselessly,
in those rubber-soles which had already served
him well that night, he tip-toed down the hall to
the foot of the stairs, where he paused to glance
around. Even in the semi-darkness, the ruinous,
uninhabited look of the place was unmistakable.
There was not a stick of furniture to be seen&mdash;nothing
but odds and ends of rubbish, a few empty
packing cases and layers upon layers of dust and
cobwebs. Blotches of mold and mildew streaked
the walls; a damp chill penetrated to his very marrow.
On either side of the hall, doors opened into
various rooms, but these rooms were dark, and it
was evidently not on this floor that the activities
of the wireless gang were centered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>Cavanaugh lost little time in the survey. His
teeth were chattering with nervousness and cold
and he wanted to be moving. From above still
came an intermittent sound of movement and that
same clink of metallic objects which he had been
unable before to place. Whoever was up there
had evidently not yet taken alarm, and Cavvy
quickly decided that it would be safe to venture
further.</p>
<p>He took the stairs slowly, keeping close to the
wall to avoid awkward creakings. Presently his
eyes reached the level of the floor above and he
saw that the light came through an open door not
far from the head of the stairs. Dropping on
hands and knees, he crept up the few remaining
steps, gained the door and peered eagerly through
the crack.</p>
<p>From this point of vantage his glance swept
curiously around the room. It was a large one,
the walls streaked and spotted, with rotting remnants
of paper hanging down in strips. The
meager attempts at furnishing dotted the floor
sparsely, like an oases in a desert. A bed, a table
holding a small oil lamp, a couple of old chairs
and a small, round stove thrust into the wide,
old fashioned fireplace, practically comprised
these furnishings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>But against the outer wall was the most interesting
feature of them all and one which instantly
riveted the boy&rsquo;s attention. A wide, rough bench
stood there holding a complete wireless apparatus.
That is, it had been complete at no very distant
time. Just now it was being dismantled as rapidly
as the nimble fingers of the fat man could accomplish
the task. His back was toward the door,
but wires, screws, switches, and various other
wireless parts lay about in confusion, while the
twitching elbows projecting from the rear of that
grotesque, massive figure told something of the
feverish haste with which the demolition was being
carried on.</p>
<p>The sight thrilled Cavvy and absorbed him for
a moment. It looked decidedly as if the plotters
had taken alarm and were making ready for a
hurried flight. And the cause of that alarm was
not difficult to locate. As Cavanaugh&rsquo;s glance
shifted again about the room, he started and
narrowly escaped betraying himself by a surprised
gasp.</p>
<p>Close to the open door and partly hidden by it,
stood a straight backed wooden chair. Someone
was sitting in it and for an instant Cavvy wondered
if this was still another member of the gang.
Then in a flash he realized that the person&rsquo;s hands
were tied together around the back of the chair,
and recognized the crisp black hair and familiar
profile of&mdash;Bill McBride!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small">ESCAPE</span></h2>
<p>Cavvy caught his breath and instinctively
drew back. His heart was thumping violently
and the hand which held the stick
shook a little. Presently he managed to control
himself and took another peep through the crack
of the door. The fat man was still absorbed in
dismantling the wireless, but it seemed certain
that his companion&rsquo;s absence must soon arouse
his suspicions. Besides, though the man below
was helpless, there was nothing to prevent his
using his lungs as soon as he recovered consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to hustle,&rdquo; thought the boy desperately.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to cut that rope before something
happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swiftly he laid the stick down on the hall floor
and taking out his scout knife, opened the largest
blade. Then he got down on hands and knees and
crept to the doorway and across the threshold.
The chair to which McBride was tied hid him
from the fat man and another discovery heartened
him not a little and brought a momentary
sparkle to his eyes. The key was in the lock on
the outside of the door. No doubt when the room
was not in use it was kept carefully secured, and
Cavvy realized comforting possibilities in the
fact.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>His chief worry at the moment was that Micky
might give a start or an exclamation which would
betray him. But fortunately the boy&rsquo;s self control
stood the test. As Cavvy, crouching behind
the chair, pressed his knife blade across the
knotted rope, there was a slight quiver of the
bound hands, a swift drawn breath that was
barely audible, but that was all. A moment later
the severed rope slipped down and Cavanaugh
gripped the other&rsquo;s arm and drew him gently
toward the door.</p>
<p>All would have gone well but for an abominably
squeaky board. At the sound the fat man
straightened with a jerk and whirled around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; cried Cavvy, jerking McBride across
the threshold.</p>
<p>There was a bellow of rage from the fat man
and a swift forward rush. The door crashed shut
and the key clicked in a well oiled lock. Close
together the two boys whirled around the newel
post and tore downstairs, urged on by the muffled,
angry cries and poundings on the door. At the
foot of the stairs Micky stumbled and fell headlong,
but Cavvy dragged him up and they gained
the outer door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>The sprawling body of the man still lay across
the threshold. But as they leaped over it and
reached the open, a snarling curse burst from
him followed by a volley of threats and execrations.</p>
<p>To these the boys paid no heed. Dashing
around the corner of the house they made for the
road as fast as the inky darkness and the unfamiliar
ground permitted. Once they stumbled into
the oozy margin of the stagnant pond. Again
Cavanaugh ran against a rusty reaper abandoned
in the grass and barked his shin painfully. They
were constantly tripping and falling over unseen
obstacles, but they never paused and at length
they gained the belt of trees and undergrowth
which surrounded the clearing.</p>
<p>Here they slowed down to get their breath and
listen for sounds of possible pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d&mdash;hardly come&mdash;this far,&rdquo; panted Cavanaugh.
&ldquo;Do you&mdash;hear anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; gasped Micky. &ldquo;Nothing but&mdash;the rain
and&mdash;wind. Whew! I&rsquo;m winded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a space the silence was unbroken save by
the sound of their suppressed panting. Then
Cavvy turned and began to push through the undergrowth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be going,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take
a while to find the road, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>McBride followed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pippin, old man,
to get me out of that mess,&rdquo; he said presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; shrugged Cavvy. &ldquo;How
did you ever come to get into it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I was a nut, I guess,&rdquo; answered McBride
in an apologetic tone. &ldquo;All the same, he
showed up so suddenly and jumped on me so
quick, I honestly didn&rsquo;t have a chance to do a
thing&mdash;not even to let out a yell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the tall chap with the black beard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. I was standing there beside the door
trying to follow you by the rustling you made,&rdquo;
McBride explained. &ldquo;All at once there was the
dickens of a flash in my eyes and the next second
somebody grabbed me by the throat and half
choked me. I squirmed around and kicked him
on the shins a couple of times; then he must have
choked me tighter, for I sort of went woozy and
the next thing I knew I was inside the house and
the door shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened then?&rdquo; asked Cavvy interestedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;He dragged me upstairs and held me down
in a chair, while the fat fellow tied my hands.
They wanted to find out what I was doing there,
of course. The tall guy didn&rsquo;t talk much; just
stood alongside and glowered. It was Fatty who
asked the questions&mdash;about a thousand of &rsquo;em, I
should say. He wanted to know who I was, and
where I came from, and what I was doing there
and a lot more. He was especially keen to know
where the other fellows were, and I told him&mdash;&rdquo;
Micky gave a chuckle of satisfaction&mdash;&ldquo;I told
him we&rsquo;d seen the wires and suspected a wireless,
and the others had gone back to town to get the
police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! It was worth a whole lot to see the way
they took it. They were scared green&mdash;at least
Fatty was. The other guy was madder than a
hornet and worried some, too. I stuck to the
yarn&mdash;of course it wasn&rsquo;t true, Cavvy, but you&rsquo;ve
got to stretch things sometimes with skunks like
that, haven&rsquo;t you? And after all it was only what
we would have done in a little while. Well, the
two went off in a corner and gassed a lot. Finally
Fatty began taking down the wireless and the big
guy pussy-footed out of the room and down
stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear anything a little while after he&rsquo;d
gone?&rdquo; asked Cavanaugh interestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I did, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure. I was
worried stiff, because it seemed as if he might
sneak out and nab you when you came down from
the tree. So I listened as well as I could and after
a while I heard what sounded like a thump. But
I couldn&rsquo;t be sure, for just then Fatty dropped
a coil on the floor and it made the dickens of a
racket. Was there a thump?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was,&rdquo; returned Cavvy grimly. &ldquo;I was
standing just outside the door when your friend
opened it, and I beaned him with your stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Briefly, and with many interruptions caused
by their progress through the thickets toward
the road, he went on to relate what followed and
then returned to a consideration of the second
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he come at you, Bill?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Was it from the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he couldn&rsquo;t have. I was standing right
beside the door and it never opened, I&rsquo;m sure.
He must have come around the corner of the building
and snapped a flashlight on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The motor car,&rdquo; murmured Cavvy to himself.
&ldquo;It was just as I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of passing, the car must have stopped
and the man made his way to the house unperceived
by the waiting Ferris and Ritter. For a
moment Cavvy considered the possibility of hunting
up that car and driving back in it to town.
Then he realized that still another member of the
gang might have been left in it, and abandoned
the idea. While he was still lamenting the necessity
of this, they pushed through a final fringe of
bushes and stepped out on the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else but to hoof it back to
town,&rdquo; he said in a low tone. &ldquo;We ought&mdash; Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>They both held their breath and in the ensuing
silence they heard the throbbing of a motor, growing
rapidly louder and more distinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a car coming!&rdquo; exclaimed McBride excitedly.
&ldquo;Do you suppose Rit and Champ could
have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly as a flash of light suddenly
illumined the mist. Brighter it grew and
brighter still. Then all at once two brilliant headlights
popped into view and behind them another
pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll take a chance,&rdquo; muttered Cavanaugh.</p>
<p>He stepped out in the middle of the road and
held up both hands. His figure stood out clearly
in the glare of the approaching lamps and presently,
with a jarring grind of brakes, the foremost
car slowed down and came to a standstill a few
feet away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em, Cavvy,&rdquo; shrilled Ritter&rsquo;s
voice from the depths of the tonneau. &ldquo;A farmer
down the road drove us to town and we found&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavanaugh did not hear the rest. His eyes
were fixed on the welcome and familiar face of the
County Sheriff, who had stepped out into the
road followed by several deputies. There were
others in the second car, and a few moments later
the boy was hastily explaining the situation to a
group of keen-eyed, competent looking men gathered
about him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;The car&rsquo;s the first thing,&rdquo; stated Sheriff
Mardon crisply. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll try to get away in
that. Scatter along the road, fellows. It&rsquo;s likely
run into the bushes a ways. Hustle, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were plenty of lanterns and flashlights,
and by their aid the search began. It was quickly
over. Cavvy had lingered behind to have a word
with the other two scouts when, from a point a
hundred yards or so ahead there came a sudden
bedlam of voices and the sounds of a scuffle. The
scouts dashed forward at a run, but when they
reached the spot the brief excitement was over.</p>
<p>Along one side of the road, its hood just protruding
from the bushes, stood a small car with
all lights out. In front of it were two hatless
figures with hands upraised, who glared malevolently
at the circle of officers surrounding them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These your men?&rdquo; asked the sheriff curtly as
Cavvy came up.</p>
<p>The latter nodded and the sheriff turned to a
deputy beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take &rsquo;em in charge, George,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Three or four of you men had better stay with
him. Don&rsquo;t take any chances of their slipping
off. Now, son, suppose you show us where this
plant is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>Five minutes later they were standing in the
upper room of the deserted house, which showed
every sign of a hurried flight. The sheriff viewed
what remained of the wireless outfit with a grim
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught with the goods,&rdquo; he said in a tone of
satisfaction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a case for the Department of
Justice, all right. I&rsquo;ll leave a couple of deputies
&rsquo;till their man can take charge.&rdquo; He turned to
Cavanaugh. &ldquo;You kids have done a mighty good
day&rsquo;s work, son,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;I want to hear
all about how you came to think it out. Suppose
you drop in at my office to-morrow and&mdash;&rdquo; He
broke off, his eyes widening. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re the
boy scout who sold me Liberty Bonds, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavvy nodded, his eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed the man. &ldquo;Got me to take
twice as much as I was going to, at that. Well,
it was a good job even if I did get stung, and now
you&rsquo;ve done a better one. Let&rsquo;s get a going.
Don&rsquo;t forget to come and tell me all about this
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the stairs Cavvy heard the big, burly fellow
chuckle again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be hanged,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Boy Scouts!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small">THE LONELY SOLDIER</span></h2>
<p>Private John Farren of Seattle, glanced
listlessly out of the barracks&rsquo; window and
sighed. It was not a very cheerful view.
The snow drove past his vision in fine, slanting
lines that veiled and softened the raw outlines of
the building across the cantonment street. It
had been falling steadily all night, and Farren
was tired of the soft, monotonous brush of icy
particles against the glass. It took very little today
to tire him. A month in the contagious ward
of a camp hospital is apt to weaken nerves as
well as body, and Farren had come out only the
afternoon before.</p>
<p>A laugh from the other end of the room, loud,
hearty, a little strident, brought a frown to his
face and made him lift languidly on one elbow to
glance across the rows of neat cots to where a
group of men in khaki was gathered intimately
in the further corner. There were six or eight
of them, bright-eyed, alert, pleasant looking chaps.
Their uniforms were still a trifle new, perhaps,
but already there was a touch of the soldierly in
carriage and bearing in spite of the brief tenure
of their training.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>Yet Farren, after a single glance, dropped back
on his cot, a pang of bitterness in his heart.
That was the very corner where he had been wont
to gather with his chum, Dick Harley, with chuckling,
smiling Bruce Ballard, with lank, taciturn
MacComber, and a dozen other of those men whom
six months of close association had transformed
from strangers into the most intimate of friends.</p>
<p>Where were they now, these men who had come
to mean so much to him? In France, no doubt.
He could not tell. He only knew that while he
lay helpless in the hospital his regiment had gone,
bag and baggage, leaving him behind. The nature
of his illness made it impossible for them to even
come and say good-by. He had returned yesterday
to the barracks which had been his home for
months to find it full of strangers&mdash;strangers who
had already acquired an air of permanent possession,
which made him feel, curiously, as if he
were the rookie and they the old established veterans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>The newcomers had not been deliberately indifferent.
It was simply that they had already
formed their little cliques and friendships. And
with Christmas day at hand, there was the exciting
lottery of leave to occupy them, the interest
of Christmas letters and Christmas parcels to fill
their minds. An added obstacle, too, was Farren&rsquo;s
lassitude and weakness, which made the
mere act of friendly overture an effort he could
not bring himself to tackle. So he simply slipped
back into his place, silent, reserved, desperately
lonely. He did not even try for leave. Of what
use would that be to him when he knew no one in
the East and had no place to go? Once, to be
sure, he thought of the Boy Scouts he had come
to know so pleasantly. They were mighty nice
chaps, and he felt they liked him. But at this
season they were probably too full of Christmas
fun and excitement to give him even a thought.</p>
<p>A lump rose in Farren&rsquo;s throat, his lids drooped
defendingly. And out of the sheltering darkness,
the soft swish of snow sounding in his ears,
there rose a picture of&mdash;Home! There were dear,
familiar faces in that picture, shadowy familiar
objects in its background. And because Farren
was young and rather weak and very lonely, he
clung desperately to the illusion, quite failing
to hear the click of a door opening or the rapid
thud of feet across the bare boards. The footsteps
ceased abruptly and there came a momentary
pause. Then a low, eager voice broke
through his reverie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack! Are you asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Farren&rsquo;s lids flashed up and he blinked
dazedly. Beside the cot a boy of fifteen looked
down on him&mdash;a red-cheeked, dark-eyed boy with
snow powdering his mackinaw and clinging to
hair and lashes. Farren&rsquo;s eyes widened, his lips
parted in a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Micky!&rdquo; he cried, struggling to a sitting
posture. &ldquo;When did you blow in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This minute. I&rsquo;ve just come from the hospital.&rdquo;
He caught the man&rsquo;s thin, white fingers
and squeezed them tightly. &ldquo;Gee! but I&rsquo;m glad
to see you out, Jack!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been
perfect ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farren smiled wrily. &ldquo;It has that,&rdquo; he agreed.
&ldquo;I began to think they were going to keep me
there forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo; asked McBride, sitting
down on the side of the cot. &ldquo;A little rocky
yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of,&rdquo; nodded Farren. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick up,
though, in a day or so. It&mdash;it just seems a little
queer getting back and finding&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A roar of laughter came from the far corner
of the room and he broke off, wincing unconsciously.
The boy, following the direction of his
glance, nodded comprehendingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said in a low tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beastly!
But maybe they&rsquo;ll send you after them. We&mdash;we
saw them off at the station. It was great,
but it made me feel&mdash;sort of queer. They gave us
all sorts of messages for you&mdash;Dick and Mac and
Bruce, and all the others. They said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused. Farren had turned abruptly and
was staring out at the driving snow. For a moment
the boy hesitated. Then one hand reached
out and gently touched the other&rsquo;s sleeve. A
moment later, his voice, elaborately casual, broke
the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get leave this afternoon, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave? What for? What would I do with
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farren&rsquo;s tone was dull and listless, but his face
softened a little as he looked into Micky&rsquo;s eager,
smiling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that,&rdquo; the boy answered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you have enough to do.
I&rsquo;ll bet the old man would let you off now if you
asked him. You&rsquo;ve been sick and all that, and
I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re fit to do any work yet.
Come ahead and try. We want you for all day.
Cavvy&rsquo;s waiting outside with a sleigh. I don&rsquo;t
believe you ever had a sleigh ride before. They
don&rsquo;t have any snow in Seattle, do they?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not often,&rdquo; admitted Farren. He hesitated
a moment longer and then stood up slowly. His
curiosity was roused, and unconsciously his load
of depression was lightening. &ldquo;What the deuce
have you boys got up your sleeves?&rdquo; he asked
doubtfully.</p>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s eyes danced. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a secret,&rdquo; he
grinned. &ldquo;You just go and get off for all day
and leave the rest to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farren smiled back at the boy, a pleasant glow
stealing over him. After all there were some
who seemed to care whether or not he spent
Christmas day lying around the barracks. His
glance strayed to McBride&rsquo;s legs, neatly encased
in khaki.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all dolled up in your scout clothes,&rdquo; he
remarked, reaching for his overcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! This is a scout stunt&mdash;sort of. Here
let&rsquo;s hold that for you. Where&rsquo;s your hat? Oh,
I see. There! Now, let&rsquo;s get going. We&rsquo;ve got
a lot of things to do yet, and it&rsquo;s getting later
every minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slipped an arm through Farren&rsquo;s, and together
they walked the length of the barracks
and out into the storm. As the door closed behind
them the man was conscious of a sense of
relief, as if in that act he had shut behind him,
also, a host of memories and regrets and unattainable
longings. For a time, at least, he was
free from the bitterness of the past and the uncertainty
of the future. His eyes brightened and
a faint color came into his face. Life wasn&rsquo;t such
an entirely hopeless business, after all, he thought
as he tilted his hat against the driving snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>There proved to be no difficulty in getting leave
for the day, and almost before he realized it they
had reached the cantonment entrance and found
Jim Cavanaugh driving a sleigh slowly up and
down the road. His greeting was quite as eager
and enthusiastic as McBride&rsquo;s had been; and
presently, tucked between the two, thick furs
drawn up to his chin, Farren relaxed with a contented
sigh. The snow drove against his face,
bringing the blood tingling responsive to his
cheeks. The merry jingle of the bells sounded
in his ears. On either hand the white countryside
swept by, veiled, mysterious, pleasantly unfamiliar
behind that curtain of flying particles.</p>
<p>Pleasantly mysterious, too, was their destination.
Farren tried to wheedle something out of
the boys, but both refused to give him any satisfaction.
They were full of news, having quantities
of things to tell him of what had happened
during his illness. Chief among them was the
exciting incident of the hidden wireless and how
the captured men had proved to be German spies
of the most flagrant type.</p>
<p>Seeing that his curiosity must remain ungratified,
Farren resigned himself to the inevitable and
listened with much interest to the tale, which
culminated in the arrival of Government Secret
Service agents, who heartily congratulated the
scouts and carried off the plotters to, as Cavvy
put it&mdash;&ldquo;Goodness knows where.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>After all, there was a distinct pleasure in just
sitting there, warm, comfortable, relaxed, taking
part in the boys&rsquo; gay chatter, conscious of their
friendly interest with back of it all that intangible
sense of a surprise party looming in the future.</p>
<p>In the town they made several stops where
bulky, mysterious looking parcels were tucked
into the back of the sleigh, adding to the feeling
of festivity. Farren rather expected that they
would then head for one of the boys&rsquo; homes, where
he would probably be invited to take part in the
family Christmas dinner. But to his surprise
Cavanaugh drove straight down the main street
and on out into the country again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, son,&rdquo; he said with mock severity,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going to try any kidnapping stunt, I
hope. Don&rsquo;t forget I&rsquo;ve got to report back at
camp before nine o&rsquo;clock, or it&rsquo;ll be the guard
house for mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavvy grinned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll return you before that in first class shape,
charges paid and all the rest of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the parcel will be a few pounds heavier
than when it was posted,&rdquo; chuckled McBride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>Farren smiled, but inwardly was puzzled. So
it was a Christmas dinner, then&mdash;but where? He
knew most of the Wharton scouts well; a few of
them intimately. Not one, so far as he could recall,
lived as far out as this.</p>
<p>His bewilderment increased when the cutter left
the main road and turned to the right into a country
road that led back into the hills. It curved
along, winding through bits of woods, past level
white stretches which might have been swamp or
meadow land, or between bush-strewn pastures.
The storm had lessened a little and presently the
red front of a low farm house loomed warmly
through the snow. But they passed that, too, and
a little later, when Cavanaugh pulled the horse
again sharply to the right into a narrow, twisting
track, Farren gave up all speculation, and settled
back comfortably to enjoy his outing.</p>
<p>The road was steep as well as narrow and the
horse took it at a walk. On either side towered
great pines and hemlocks, their laden branches
sweeping almost to the ground. Yet here and
there through little openings one could glimpse
the close-set ranks of dark trunks standing out
sharply against the snow, which seemed to stretch
on indefinitely. Still climbing steadily, they made
a turn and presently another. Then the track
levelled abruptly, and in another moment they
came out into an open space and stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are,&rdquo; said McBride, throwing
aside the fur robes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>Farren&rsquo;s eyes swept the clearing interestedly.
It seemed to be a bare, rocky shoulder on one of
the high hills which looked down on Wharton.
From here, on fine days, one could no doubt get
a widespread view of hill and dale and open country.
But Farren was not thinking of the view
just now. His attention was riveted on the
structure of logs which stood before him, nestling
against a background of pines. It was a
log cabin, long, low, with an overhanging roof
and a great stone chimney rising at one end. Out
of the chimney smoke curled; the small-paned
window glowed with the cheery gleam of fire; the
tang of burning wood came pleasantly to his
senses. And as he stared, heedless for the moment
of Cavvy&rsquo;s question of how he liked it, the
door flew open and a horde of boys in scout uniform
burst out pell-mell and clustered around the
sleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas!&rdquo; they shouted exuberantly.
&ldquo;Merry Christmas, Jack! How&rsquo;s the boy? It&rsquo;s
great to see you again. Lay off him, you roughnecks;
don&rsquo;t paw him to pieces. Give him a
chance to get his breath.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Farren grinned broadly as he stepped from the
sleigh into the throng of dancing, excited youngsters.
&ldquo;I certainly need it,&rdquo; he laughed, ruffling
one boy&rsquo;s hair and slapping another on the back.
&ldquo;You fellows put one over on me this time, all
right. But how did it ever come to be here?
You didn&rsquo;t build it yourselves, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, no!&rdquo; returned Cavvy. &ldquo;Not that we
aren&rsquo;t capable of it if it had been necessary, you
understand. But we put some magnificent
finishing touches to the interior and furnished it
completely. We wanted it to be a surprise for
you and Dick and the others. But before we
got it quite ready they&mdash;they went, so you&rsquo;re the
only one left to take part in the house warming.
Come ahead in and look the joint over. Furn,
hold the horse a minute, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took Farren&rsquo;s arm, and with Micky on the
other side, and the remainder of the boys trailing
behind, they tramped through the snow to the
open door and stepped inside.</p>
<p>And there they paused, the man surprised, fascinated.
He had been prepared, no matter what
he found, to show surprise and approval if for
no other reason than to satisfy the boyish pride
of his hosts. But as it happened there was no
pretense necessary; his emotion was entirely
genuine and very keen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<h2 id="c31">CHAPTER XXXI
<br /><span class="small">THE PARTING OF THE WAYS</span></h2>
<p>The interior was a single room some
twenty-five feet long and over half as
wide, the walls of pine logs carefully
trimmed and notched, with joints made tight with
cement. Opposite the door yawned a cavernous
fireplace of rough stone in which a pile of four
foot logs roared and crackled.</p>
<p>That much there had been on that October night
when the scouts first occupied the cabin; otherwise
one would have scarcely have recognized it
as the same place. Another pair of bunks had
been added to match the first. Over the fireplace
hung a fine moosehead beautifully mounted, and
here and there above the windows or on the walls
were other horns of elk, caribou or deer. There
were several bear skins on the floor, shelves containing
tinware and dishes, several big, comfortable
armchairs, a heavy table piled with packages
and boxes. And hanging from the rafters, or
festooned about the antlers or along the walls,
thick ropes of hemlock mingled with glossy mountain
laurel lent a festive note to the picture and
filled the room with the pungent fragrance of
Christmastide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>It was a picture to stir the imagination of any
boy, old or young, and John Farren was stirred
deeply. In that instant as he stared around, there
came to him a vivid memory of the hunter&rsquo;s shack
on the Pacific slope which he had found and renovated
with such pride in those boyhood days
which now seemed so remote and far away.
Swift on the heels of this, there flashed over him
in one queer mental medley, the thought of home,
of Christmas trees, of his mother&rsquo;s smiling face,
his little sister&rsquo;s shrill, sweet laugh. And mixed
up with those fleeting brain pictures, were vague,
blurred visions of skates and toys and candy&mdash;even
of stockings hung before another fire whose
ashes had been cold a thousand years.</p>
<p>He blinked&mdash;and was back in the present again,
the boys clustered around him, the real fire hot
against his face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great, fellows&mdash;simply
great!&rdquo; he said in a voice which was not quite
steady. &ldquo;I never saw anything so corking as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, his gaze fixed incredulously on the
rough oak slab which formed the mantel. A long,
black stocking hung there, bulging, distended, and
for a moment he thought his brain was playing
tricks. Then someone behind him snickered and
Cavanaugh gave him a gentle forward push.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;Santa Claus was here and left that with your
name on it, Jack,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Better take a
look at it. The kids are itching to see what&rsquo;s in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amidst a laughing chorus of denial from the
youngsters, Farren stepped quickly forward. The
stocking was very real and solid to the touch,
bulging along its length with mysterious, suggestive
bumps and corners. Pinned to the top
was a card on which was written in painstaking
script: &ldquo;J. Farren; Merry Christmas.&rdquo; Farren
read it slowly; then he laughed&mdash;a sudden,
bubbling, infectious laugh, and faced around, the
stocking in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a great old scout, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he chuckled.
&ldquo;Think of his knowing I was going to be here
when I didn&rsquo;t even know it myself! He must
have had some silent partners about. Where&rsquo;s
a chair? I&rsquo;ve got to sit down and take this
slowly. I haven&rsquo;t had a Christmas stocking for
goodness knows how long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>He dragged one of the big chairs up to the
table and with the boys crowding around, he began
to empty the stocking. It was crammed with
parcels of various sizes, some neatly tied in tissue
with red ribbons, others showing the work of
clumsy fingers in their rumpled, wrinkled wrappings.
But each separate one, as its contents was
revealed, bore evidence in some way of painstaking
thought, of kindness, even of sacrifice. There
was a jack-knife, new and shining in its chamois
case, a money belt, a leather covered shaving glass.
There were packets of writing paper, some handkerchiefs,
soap, chocolate, a box of cigarettes, besides
many other articles of utility or luxury. As
he opened them, Farren kept up a brisk running
fire of comment and approval, but when they all
lay spread before him, he sat motionless for a
moment, his head a little bent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is corking of you, fellows&mdash;simply corking,&rdquo;
he said presently in a low tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
nicest thing that ever happened to me, and I&mdash;I
won&rsquo;t forget it in a hurry.&rdquo; He raised his head
and flashed about the circle a smile of gratitude
and appreciation. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say any more than&mdash;thank
you; but I mean that a thousand times,
and I want to shake hands with every one of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up abruptly, releasing the slight
touch of embarrassment which, for just an instant,
had held them silent. When the handshakings
were over the cabin resounded again with a babel
of talk and laughter, which presently merged into
the bustle of preparation, for it appeared that a
regular Christmas dinner was to be cooked and
served.</p>
<p>Farren was eager to help, but his offers were
firmly refused, and he was ordered to make himself
comfortable by the fire while the others got
busy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if you see anything being done
wrong, you can draw our attention to it,&rdquo; said
Jim Cavanaugh, his eyes twinkling. &ldquo;A fellow
can&rsquo;t remember everything all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll remember more than I should,&rdquo;
laughed Farren. &ldquo;What I don&rsquo;t know about
cooking would fill a large volume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re none of us experts,&rdquo; admitted Cavvy.
&ldquo;Still, I reckon we&rsquo;ll make out somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of his modesty, the work went forward
in a businesslike manner which betokened either
uncommon culinary skill, or a good deal of expert
advice obtained beforehand. Farren drew
up a chair to one side of the blaze and watched
everything interestedly, keeping up a running
fire of joke and comment with the cooks and
their helpers. Once or twice he got up and
strolled about the room, admiring the furnishings
and decorations, and each time a scout or two accompanied
him to make sure he missed no special
feature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>But gradually the interest centered around the
fireplace. The fire had been allowed to die
down and a thick bed of glowing coals raked forward
to accommodate the various cooking operations
which were going forward in every available
corner of the wide stone hearth. Sweet potatoes
boiled merrily in one receptacle; onions in
another. From a heavy iron crane above them
hung a large and ample kettle, a trickle of steam
rising from its spout. These, however, were
minor details of the banquet, interesting as accessories,
but of no real importance compared
with the principal dish which occupied the center
of the stage and absorbed the anxious attention
of the entire assemblage.</p>
<p>In the middle of the hearth stood a heavy iron
grate supporting a large tin oven. Cavanaugh,
and Steve Haddon, who was in from Washington
for a week, squatted before it, each holding an
iron poker with which, at frequent intervals, they
raked forward fresh coals to replenish the heap
beneath the grate. And at intervals almost as
frequent one or the other opened the oven door
to peer within. Their movements were followed
anxiously by every scout not otherwise fully occupied,
and there was no lack of advice from the
many onlookers. This was received by the two
cooks with contemptuous jeers, but there was,
nevertheless, a slight touch of tension in their
manner, a decided caution of movement, a keen
attention to details. For in that oven, trussed,
stuffed already delicately browning, reposed&mdash;<i>the
turkey</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother wanted us to have it cooked at home
and just warm it up in the cabin,&rdquo; explained
Cavvy to Farren with a touch of scorn. &ldquo;But,
gee! What&rsquo;s the use of having a turkey if you
can&rsquo;t <i>smell</i> it cooking!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like it,&rdquo; agreed the soldier,
sniffing the air appreciatively. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it make
you hungry, though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said it!&rdquo; came in unison from several
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure it won&rsquo;t get burned, Cavvy?&rdquo;
added McBride, who had charge of the onions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think we&rsquo;re sitting here watching
it for?&rdquo; retorted Cavanaugh with some heat.
&ldquo;You look after those onions and don&rsquo;t bother
about the turkey. I&rsquo;ll bet you haven&rsquo;t made the
cream sauce yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rit&rsquo;s mixing it up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he wants to get some speed on. This
bird will be dished up in twenty minutes sharp,
and we want all the other grub ready by that
time. How are the potatoes, Red?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flushed but smiling, Red Garrity withdrew the
fork he had just plunged into the bubbling pail.
&ldquo;Just about done,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better set &rsquo;em off to one side, then, and about
five minutes before we&rsquo;re ready you can peel them
and put &rsquo;em on a plate. When he gets out of
there, Chick, you slick on the plum pudding to
heat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>To most of them that twenty minutes dragged
interminably, but like all other similar periods of
waiting, it came to an end at last. When all the
other accessories of the banquet had been placed
on the carefully set table, Cavanaugh and Haddon
together lifted the oven from the fire to the hearth
and removed the steaming fowl to a platter placed
in readiness. There was a moment of gasping
suspense as Cavvy brushed one hand against the
hot metal and nearly dropped his end of the load.
But he hung on, and the calamity was averted at
the expense of a red ridge across three fingers.
A moment later the turkey was laid triumphantly
on the board and the boys scrambled to their
places, with sighs of mingled relief and anticipation.</p>
<p>The latter were more than justified. No turkey,
it seemed to them, had ever been so plump and
juicy, so tender, so crisply brown, so succulent of
dressing. The creamed onions were delicious, the
potatoes done to a turn, the brown gravy plentiful
and thick. They ate and ate, and passed their
plates for more. When the first pangs of hunger
had been assuaged, jesting and banter began to
run up and down the table, compliments phrased
in the inverse to terms of boyhood were showered
upon the cooks, who tried not to look too proud
as they themselves enthusiastically consumed the
products of their skill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>John Farren&rsquo;s enjoyment of the meal was utter
and complete. The food really was delicious, but
better than any material pleasure was the mental
relaxation that had come to him. His
troubles had quite vanished, his laugh rang clear
and unrestrained, and he joined in the joking give
and take with all the mischievous abandon of a
boy.</p>
<p>So the feast passed on to its predestined end.
And when the turkey lay dismembered on its platter,
looking like the yawning wreck of some
stranded derelict, when the plum pudding had
vanished save for a few crumbs and every other
dish was scraped quite clean, the boys arose with
sighs of repletion and gathered around the fireplace.
Fresh logs were piled upon the embers,
skins dragged up, and they crowded in a close
semi-circle before the blaze with Farren in the
center.</p>
<p>Outside the early dusk had fallen, the whispering
touch of snow flakes brushed against window
panes or across the roof. Now and again
the wind howled eerily in the chimney. But inside
the cabin was only warmth and cheer and
comradeship. And as the dancing flames lit up
that circles of boyish faces, some flushed and
drowsy, others bright-eyed and alert, each one
meeting his own glance now and then with a
friendly smile, Farren thrilled oddly. McBride
sat close on one side of him, little Furn Barber
nestled against the other. And presently, when
the small boy began to nod, Farren slid an arm
around his shoulder and drew the tousled head
down upon his knee. How could he have thought
the world cold and lonely, he wondered?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>They did not sit long in silence. There were
jokes and laughter, a story or two, and presently
someone started up a song. But all too soon came
the jingle of bells and the muffled stamping of
the horse, brought up from the red farm house
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to break up the party,&rdquo; said Cavanaugh,
scrambling to his feet; &ldquo;but you know
we promised to return you on time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Farren stood up, smiling a little
at Barber&rsquo;s dazed awakening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the
least bit keen to leave, but of course I must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not easy to tell them what that day had
meant to him. They could not understand it all;
he hoped they never would. But when he had
finished, at least they knew that he was grateful.
There was a brisk bustle of handshaking, a chorus
of good-bys, and he was in the sleigh, looking
back at the open door filled with smiling faces
and wildly waving hands. Then the faces
blurred into mere outlines, black against the glow
of the fire, the friendly voices grew fainter, there
came a turn in the path and the cabin vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>It was nearly an hour before Cavvy and McBride
returned, but it was an hour well spent in
washing dishes and tidying up generally. It is
just possible that this job <i>might</i> have been put off
till morning but for the fact that the entire crowd
was spending the night here and needed every
inch of room. The clearing up had hardly been
finished before the two boys were heard outside
kicking the snow from their feet. A moment
later they entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greatest news you ever heard,&rdquo; exclaimed
Cavanaugh at once, stripping off his mackinaw
and hanging it on some horns to dry. &ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s
going over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Right away?&rdquo; inquired several voices
at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. He starts the first thing in the morning.
His Colonel&rsquo;s had word that the regiment
will be a month longer wherever they are in
France before going to the front, so he&rsquo;s sending
four or five men who were left behind to join it.
Jack&rsquo;s about crazy with joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think he would be,&rdquo; remarked Steve
Haddon slowly. &ldquo;It must have been tough having
all the others go without him. I&rsquo;d hate it,
I know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>No one answered him directly. At the further
end of the room the youngsters were raucously
disputing over sleeping places, but on the four
or five older scouts gathered before the fire a sudden,
thoughtful silence had fallen. A year from
now where would they all be! Scarcely together
as they were to-night. Presently Cavvy caught
Steve&rsquo;s eye and his arm dropped across the
other&rsquo;s shoulder to rest there with a faint pressure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So should I,&rdquo; he agreed. Then he smiled.
&ldquo;Steve, old scout,&rdquo; he went on briskly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
have to enlist together when we go and maybe
they&rsquo;ll put us on the same ship. Meantime&mdash; Hanged
if I&rsquo;m not hungry again! Let&rsquo;s see if
we can&rsquo;t dig up some cold turkey.&rdquo;</p>
